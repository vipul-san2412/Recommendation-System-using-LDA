1
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,167
Let's do things differently this time.

2
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:12,355
<i>So</i> differently.

3
00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:17,151
His name is Miles Morales.

4
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,879
He was bitten by a radioactive spider,

5
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,246
and he's not the only one.

6
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:31,705
He hasn't always had it easy.

7
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,101
And he's not the only one.

8
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:49,066
And now he's on his own.

9
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,714
And he's not the only one.

10
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,339
You think you know the rest.

11
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,581
You don't.

12
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:09,808
I thought <i>I</i> knew the rest, but...

13
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:12,508
I didn't.

14
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,426
I didn't wanna hurt him.

15
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,043
But I did.

16
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,777
And he's not the only one.

17
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:34,566
Hey!

18
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,746
Stealth Leopard!

19
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,520
Gwen!

20
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:44,427
Is the song over?

21
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:45,913
Seems over.

22
00:02:46,106 --> 00:02:47,892
- Are you okay?
- Dude, you don't hang out,

23
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,971
and you don't wanna talk...

24
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:51,151
I didn't join a band so I
could talk about my feelings!

25
00:02:51,175 --> 00:02:51,878
Well, I did.

26
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,035
I joined it so I could
hit my feelings with sticks!

27
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:57,283
-Yo, if you don't tell
someone what's going on...

28
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:58,671
- you're gonna snap.
- <i>I'm fine.</i>

29
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,598
That's not how someone
who's "fine" would say that.

30
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,249
You say,

31
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:02,490
"I'm great, thanks!

32
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,545
- How are you?"
- I'm great!

33
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:04,904
- Thanks!
- Whoa.

34
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,685
How are you?

35
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Fine...?

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,067
Gwen, come on.

37
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:11,106
I don't get you, man.

38
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:12,131
You're right!

39
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:14,219
I play drums.

40
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,505
I always wanted to be in a band.

41
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,013
Guess I just never found the right one.

42
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,851
In this line of work,

43
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:28,011
You always find out the solo act.

44
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:31,940
But before Miles,

45
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:33,714
- What? How many of these did you take?
- ...there was Peter.

46
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:35,392
I think they look great, I dunno.

47
00:03:35,417 --> 00:03:37,991
Is this... that... dangerous mask?

48
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,891
I don't know, I... she
seems like a good guy.

49
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,654
Why wear a mask if
you've got nothing to hide?

50
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,680
Alright, no politics at the dinner table.

51
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:45,518
Thank you, May.

52
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,047
But they didn't really know me.

53
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,493
And I didn't really know him, either.

54
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,953
Touch him again, Ned.

55
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:54,978
Gwen, it's okay.

56
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,363
...Until it was too late.

57
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:06,934
- Hey, Gwen!
- Hey!

58
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,949
Peter?

59
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:33,903
What?

60
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:34,928
No...!

61
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:38,605
No, no! No, no, no, no... what did you do?

62
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:42,472
I just... wanted to be special.

63
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:44,268
Like you...

64
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:45,917
Gwen.

65
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,029
Gwen...?

66
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,054
Don't worry.

67
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,484
Who's Gwen?

68
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:54,141
Everything's gonna be okay.

69
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,380
- Don't... don't go!
- Everything's gonna be okay...

70
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:01,184
Oh, Peter...

71
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:12,018
Hey, hey!

72
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,518
Hey!

73
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:14,543
Peter...?

74
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:20,328
I never really made
another friend, after that.

75
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:26,231
Except one.

76
00:05:28,206 --> 00:05:29,686
But he's not here.

77
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:34,168
And there's no way to get there.

78
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:36,177
Hush your mouths as captain George Stacy

79
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,997
leads the manhunt for
Spider woman! Who is she?

80
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:40,663
And why won't she show her face?!

81
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,290
Peter Parker, an
innocent young man...

82
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,271
I've known May and
Ben Parker for twelve years.

83
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,397
Peter Parker ate at my table.

84
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:49,230
He was my daughter's <i>best friend.</i>

85
00:05:49,255 --> 00:05:53,717
And I will not rest until I
find this Spider woman.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,543
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

87
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:08,308
How's the band?

88
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:12,020
Uhh... uh, yeah, great.
Uh, I quit, so... you know.

89
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,045
Thumbs up.

90
00:06:16,345 --> 00:06:18,865
We, uh... we caught a break
in the Spider woman case.

91
00:06:19,664 --> 00:06:20,664
Oh.

92
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,295
That's... good.

93
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,530
We're close.

94
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:24,796
I'm telling ya, I can feel it.

95
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,259
...Me, too.

96
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,210
It'll be good for us.

97
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:31,235
Don't be so sure.

98
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,694
She killed your friend.

99
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:34,521
You don't know that.

100
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,908
What do you mean I don't
know that? I <i>do</i> know that.

101
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:36,921
Y'know... I was there.

102
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,346
- She ran from the scene...
- Maybe she didn't have a choice.

103
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,137
I've got a job to do, Gwen.

104
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:42,796
It won't bring him back!

105
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,136
Uh... I don't wanna argue about this.

106
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:51,546
Okay?

107
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,337
Yeah. I can tell.

108
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,107
Say, uh...

109
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,173
Too punk rock to give your old man a hug-

110
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,342
<i>All units, possible superhuman event.</i>

111
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,236
<i>Guggenheim Musem,
suspect is Adrian Toomes...</i>

112
00:07:23,248 --> 00:07:24,131
Oh, hey. This could be it.

113
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:25,732
- <i>...also known as the Vulture.</i>
- So... I, uh...

114
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:26,756
I'll see you later?

115
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:28,887
Cool.

116
00:07:29,588 --> 00:07:30,874
Um, I'll... I'll call.

117
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:31,899
Local.

118
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:37,317
<i>49 currently on scene.
It's a real mess down here.</i>

119
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:39,651
<i>We're gonna need all the help we can get.</i>

120
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,694
-<i>This is Captain Stacy. I'm 5 out.</i>

121
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:54,947
<i>I need you to look alive, there's
a good chance our girl shows up.</i>

122
00:07:54,972 --> 00:07:57,034
<i>Tonight's the night we catch Spider woman.</i>

123
00:07:57,851 --> 00:07:58,851
Oh, great.

124
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:21,759
Fury.

125
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:25,117
Explain to me how a guy
with a 40 foot wingspan

126
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:27,449
just waltzed into the Guggenheim unnoticed?

127
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:29,420
Hey, it's New York.
Everyone's got their thing.

128
00:08:31,855 --> 00:08:33,361
You know what he wants?

129
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,674
- Do you speak Italian?
- Uhhh...

130
00:08:34,699 --> 00:08:35,929
I'm an Irish cop.

131
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:37,636
Maybe you love pasta or something.

132
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:39,276
Everybody, on my signal!

133
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:41,356
Look out for signs of Spider woman!

134
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:44,664
Hey-mmph!

135
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:45,823
We found her.

136
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,381
How's the manhunt for me going?

137
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:50,886
Good to know!

138
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:55,717
Vulture!

139
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,607
Well, screaming their name usually works.

140
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,647
I guess that worked...

141
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,872
I am the Vulture, the
pinnacle of man's genius!

142
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:13,733
You're not my Vulture. What
are you, made of parchment?

143
00:09:13,758 --> 00:09:16,448
What cursed world have you brought me to?

144
00:09:17,716 --> 00:09:19,567
You're glitching, huh? Been there.

145
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,827
Uh, where you from, bud?

146
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,468
I am an artist! An engineer!

147
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,746
Oh, great. A renaissance man.

148
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,252
-Yes!

149
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:27,277
Cool, let me guess.

150
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:32,447
You were having an espresso in some
old-timey Leonardo DaVinci dimension,

151
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:35,308
and suddenly a portal opens up,
and you wind up here,

152
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:38,718
Am I warm?

153
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,291
Yes, that's pretty much it.

154
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:42,786
Sidebar? Uh,

155
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:46,269
maybe you could stop making a
mess of the art museum for no reason?

156
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,734
You call this <i>art?</i>

157
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,207
We're talking about it, aren't we?

158
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:53,818
Oh, that's cool.

159
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,789
I mean, it's more of a
meta-commentary on what we call art,

160
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:58,814
but it's... it...

161
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,252
...it's also...art?

162
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,113
Oh, look! It's your cousin.

163
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:09,880
I wouldn't play with fire, dude,
you're kind of made of paper!

164
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:17,284
Ohh, no.

165
00:10:47,244 --> 00:10:49,084
I'm sorry, who exactly
are you supposed to be?

166
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:50,313
That's classified.

167
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:51,900
You're... the Blue Panther.

168
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:52,429
No.

169
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:53,049
The Caped "Blue-cader"?

170
00:10:53,074 --> 00:10:53,676
No, I'm...

171
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,337
Dark Garfield?

172
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,011
No. Stop.

173
00:10:55,036 --> 00:10:56,127
Macho Libre?

174
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:57,314
I'm from another dimension.

175
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,641
You <i>are?</i>

176
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,726
Wooow...

177
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:01,137
Actually, I'm not confused.

178
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,399
My name... is Miguel O'Hara.

179
00:11:03,424 --> 00:11:06,931
I lead an elite strike force dedicated
to the security of the multiverse...

180
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:07,824
Actually, forget it.

181
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:10,298
Can you go to any dimension
you want with that watch...

182
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:11,016
- ...thing?
- It's...

183
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:12,129
-much cooler than a watch.

184
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,803
Okay! Sensitive.

185
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:16,624
Look, there is a big flying
turkey from the renaissance

186
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,970
I have to bring to justice,
so if you don't mind.

187
00:11:18,995 --> 00:11:19,823
It's alright, kid.

188
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:20,377
Wow.

189
00:11:20,737 --> 00:11:22,169
I'll take it from here.

190
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:23,962
Okay. Knock yourself out.

191
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,755
Well... why are you saying it like that?

192
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,188
You're not funny!

193
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:29,023
Oh, I don't know...

194
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:35,075
It's really fun cleaning up
your shocking mess, by the way.

195
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,739
What mess?

196
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,071
Kingpin's collider!

197
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,911
What are you guys talking about?

198
00:11:38,936 --> 00:11:39,922
- None of your business!
- You shut up!

199
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:40,268
Hey!

200
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:40,801
Nosy.

201
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,461
We saved the multiverse!

202
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:45,072
You left a hole wide
enough for guys like <i>him</i>

203
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:47,748
-to randomly get shot
into the wrong dimension!

204
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,953
Now I'm stuck putting
everybody back where they belong

205
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:54,116
before all of time and space collapses!

206
00:11:54,141 --> 00:11:56,866
Now, don't even get me
started on Dr. Strange,

207
00:11:56,878 --> 00:11:59,149
the little nerd back
on Earth 1999999!

208
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:00,274
Who's Doctor Strange?

209
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,259
Sounds like he maybe
shouldn't practice medicine.

210
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:03,668
Sorry Captain,

211
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:05,653
- can't talk right now! I'll be back!
- Wait! Hey!

212
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:11,030
So, you want me to handle this one, or...?

213
00:12:16,322 --> 00:12:17,549
Huh. Okay.

214
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:28,535
<i>Ay, por Dios,</i> he's got Hammer space!

215
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:37,642
Lyla? Can you please...

216
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:38,099
y'know...

217
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,740
Nah, you gotta say it, first.

218
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,504
Call for backup.

219
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,091
What?

220
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:42,711
<i>Call for backup.</i>

221
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:43,024
C'mooon.

222
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:44,595
<i>Please,</i> just call for...

223
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,660
Yeah I already called her.

224
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,427
But I enjoyed thaaat~!

225
00:13:10,158 --> 00:13:11,158
Spider woman.

226
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:12,926
Me, too.

227
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,523
Uh... are you, uhh...

228
00:13:15,548 --> 00:13:17,019
Oh, this?

229
00:13:17,044 --> 00:13:18,660
We don't know the sex yet,

230
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:20,912
my husband wants it to be a surprise.

231
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:23,382
He's really corny. But <i>so</i> hot!

232
00:13:23,658 --> 00:13:24,758
Will you adopt me?

233
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,480
What...?

234
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:25,853
What? What??

235
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:26,954
Guys!

236
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:30,066
Can we focus on the big fire-breathing
threat to time and space, please?!

237
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:31,106
Yep! Yep, yep, yep, yep.

238
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:44,719
What about her?

239
00:13:44,744 --> 00:13:45,393
No.

240
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:46,093
We could use the help...

241
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:46,537
<i>No.</i>

242
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,571
Is it 'cuz she called you Dark Garfield?

243
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:49,109
No!

244
00:13:49,134 --> 00:13:49,985
Do you say anything but no-?

245
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,010
No.

246
00:13:51,051 --> 00:13:51,399
Yes!

247
00:13:51,424 --> 00:13:52,112
Why not?

248
00:13:52,137 --> 00:13:53,157
You know why.

249
00:13:56,406 --> 00:13:57,632
Enough of this.

250
00:13:58,747 --> 00:14:02,760
Take a good look at my
great fire from my backpack!

251
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:10,085
Don't let him out!

252
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,406
He'll disrupt the canon!

253
00:14:27,614 --> 00:14:29,794
- Go to the ground!
- Will you get out of here?!

254
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:31,383
We have you surrounded!

255
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:32,617
I'm a good guy!

256
00:14:32,642 --> 00:14:34,302
You don't look like a good guy!

257
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:36,264
You're just gonna have
to shut up and trust-

258
00:14:36,564 --> 00:14:37,278
No!

259
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:40,908
Mayday! Mayday!

260
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,383
Whoa!

261
00:15:38,859 --> 00:15:40,225
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

262
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,143
That's what I was gonna do.

263
00:15:56,326 --> 00:15:57,326
<i>Whew.</i>

264
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:20,171
<i>Ugh!</i>

265
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:21,734
Hands in the air!

266
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,193
Captain, come on.

267
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:25,315
Suspect is armed.

268
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,855
With what? I'm... I'm out of webs!

269
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,833
Get down on the ground!

270
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:29,635
Which is it? Hands in the
air, or get down on the ground?

271
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:30,571
You're under arrest.

272
00:16:30,596 --> 00:16:32,031
I just saved a bunch of people!

273
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:33,111
For the murder of Peter Parker.

274
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:35,467
-Captain, come on. I-
-You have the right to remain silent.

275
00:16:35,492 --> 00:16:37,251
- You don't understand!
- Anything you say...

276
00:16:42,622 --> 00:16:43,842
<i>You</i> don't understand.

277
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,776
Dad...

278
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:21,093
I... I've thought about... telling you.

279
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,150
But you can see why I didn't want to.

280
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,917
You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.

281
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,971
I didn't murder Peter.

282
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:28,996
-I didn't... I...

283
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,277
-I didn't know it was him!

284
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,112
- I didn't have a choice!
- How long...

285
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,737
have you been lying to me?

286
00:17:36,741 --> 00:17:37,274
Can you just...

287
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,180
Can you just not be a cop for
a second, and be my dad here,

288
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,205
and listen to me?

289
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,475
Do you really think...

290
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,541
I'm a <i>murderer?</i>

291
00:17:47,423 --> 00:17:49,916
You're in this to help people, right?

292
00:17:52,466 --> 00:17:53,466
<i>Right?</i>

293
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,288
-So am I!

294
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:59,320
And the way to help
right now is to listen to me!

295
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:01,234
-Please, Dad.

296
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:04,414
You're all I have left.

297
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,932
You have a right to remain silent.

298
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,265
- Uhh, <i>what?</i>
- Anything you say can and will be used

299
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,481
Dad, are you really
this afraid of me?!

300
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,440
Against you in a court of law.
You have a right to an attorney...

301
00:18:16,464 --> 00:18:16,990
No! Stop!

302
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,226
Don't get any closer!

303
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,087
- Dad!
- Hey, hey, hey. C'mon.

304
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
Just breathe.

305
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,660
We got you.

306
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:29,685
Right, Miguel?

307
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:33,396
Lyla.

308
00:18:33,521 --> 00:18:34,614
Scan this mess.

309
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:38,065
No further anomalies.

310
00:18:38,638 --> 00:18:40,417
Canon remains intact.

311
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:45,724
We can't just leave her here.

312
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,478
She's doing this on her own.

313
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,393
I don't know how to fix this.

314
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:08,485
Yeah.

315
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:10,144
Well...

316
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:12,329
Join the club.

317
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,125
I know he's just a sophomore,

318
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,328
but we wanna get a jump on
the college conversation, so...

319
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,185
I'm sure he's gonna be...

320
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,886
here. Any minute.

321
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:28,386
He's <i>very</i> serious about his future.

322
00:20:30,904 --> 00:20:31,904
Uhh...

323
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:46,794
Excuse me, do you have, uhh...

324
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:47,921
...an ATM machine?

325
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:49,087
Yeah, right around here, in the back.

326
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:50,649
- Preferrably <i>not</i> chained to the wall?
- What?

327
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:51,673
Uh, nothing!

328
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:53,707
This should be simple enough.

329
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,807
Just make a hole...

330
00:20:57,313 --> 00:20:58,313
grab the money.

331
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:03,774
Oh! That's not right.

332
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:05,987
Just get the-...ugh...

333
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,240
Give me your money.

334
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:09,706
Where are you, money? Where are you?

335
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:11,736
Oh...

336
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,232
Whoa!

337
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:18,621
- Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?!
- Augh!

338
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:23,130
Yo, what you doing back there, man?

339
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:23,633
-Nothing!

340
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:25,948
Nothing, everything
is... everything's cool, man!

341
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:26,569
All good!

342
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:28,075
- Just forgot my pin number!
- Get your butt out of here!

343
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,114
- Ahh! No!
- Get your butt out of here!

344
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:31,089
Sir, please! Just let me rob you!

345
00:21:31,114 --> 00:21:32,370
I'm going to rob your face!

346
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,393
There's no reason
to bring wood into this!

347
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,042
I've never robbed anybody in my life,

348
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,403
please don't make this
a bad experience for me!

349
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:38,593
Bad experience?

350
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,041
-I'm trying to run a business, here!

351
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,065
I have this whole-

352
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:42,516
Oh, wow. Is this curry powder?

353
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,605
We'll say I'm a scientist.

354
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,517
I <i>was.</i> I am!

355
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,110
I... anyway.

356
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,522
You heard of Alchemax? I used to-

357
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:47,890
I used to work there.

358
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,804
I was actually considered
handsome, by scientist standards.

359
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,557
But I had a little accident...!

360
00:21:56,462 --> 00:21:56,929
Hey!

361
00:21:56,954 --> 00:21:57,954
<i>Oof!</i>

362
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,094
I'm so sorry!

363
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,469
First of all, I'm not even robbing <i>you,</i>

364
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,706
I mean, this ATM machine
doesn't even belong to <i>you,</i> right?

365
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,566
This belongs to the bank!

366
00:22:03,591 --> 00:22:04,538
They're the real criminals!

367
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,138
<i>You're</i> the real criminal!
You're robbing <i>me!</i>

368
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,578
Y'know, I can't really get
a job anywhere anymore,

369
00:22:08,603 --> 00:22:10,602
being like <i>this,</i> so I've
turned to a life of crime,

370
00:22:10,626 --> 00:22:12,942
- I'm having trouble finding... ah!
- Why do people say "ATM machine"?

371
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:13,764
Who said that?

372
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,791
The <i>M</i> stands for "machines".

373
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,141
Spider... <i>aahh!</i>

374
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,229
Hey, Lenny. How much do I
owe you for this beef patty, man?

375
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:26,516
Spider, if you catch him,
it's on the house, brother.

376
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:27,374
Oww!

377
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:28,886
Oh! Spider man. Wow.

378
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:29,625
Ahh!

379
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,619
This is real!

380
00:22:30,644 --> 00:22:33,723
So, are you like, a cow, or a dalmation?

381
00:22:33,748 --> 00:22:34,748
I am...

382
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:37,941
The Spot.

383
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:40,076
We meet again, Spider man.

384
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,861
- Oh, that's funny to you?
- Of course not.

385
00:22:44,886 --> 00:22:45,601
No.

386
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:46,602
So, is that a costume?

387
00:22:46,627 --> 00:22:48,797
Unfortunately for both of us, this is skin.

388
00:22:48,822 --> 00:22:49,757
Oh, dang.

389
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,133
You see...

390
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:52,637
I'm from your past.

391
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:54,152
One year ago...

392
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:55,006
Hold up.

393
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:55,844
Oh, come on!

394
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:56,738
Uh oh.

395
00:22:56,763 --> 00:22:58,415
- Well, this has been fun, um...
- Who are you talking to?

396
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:01,519
- But I really gotta wrap this up.
- No, no, no! No, go ahead, take your call.

397
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,176
This job is so dumb sometimes!

398
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:10,460
Maybe just pay me now.

399
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:12,570
Okay, let's do this one last time.

400
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,513
My name is Miles Morales.

401
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:17,774
I was bitten by a radioactive spider,

402
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,145
and for the last year and four months,

403
00:23:20,828 --> 00:23:24,175
I've been Brooklyn's
one and only Spider man.

404
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,637
And things are going great.

405
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,317
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

406
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:30,054
- Whoo!
- You could hurt somebody!

407
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,247
Catching all sorts of bad guys,

408
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:39,917
Can't you just act like a regular
super villain so I can catch you?

409
00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:42,702
I designed my new suit,

410
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:45,188
with some fly ambience down the side.

411
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:46,834
Aunt May moved to Florida,

412
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,598
Done.

413
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:49,211
I guest hosted Jeopardy.

414
00:23:49,577 --> 00:23:51,217
Endorsed baby powder,

415
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:53,961
apologized for endorsing baby powder,

416
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,908
my mustache came in,

417
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:57,591
<i>Mustache</i>.

418
00:23:57,616 --> 00:23:59,651
...and out.

419
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,289
Been developing a new
twist on my venom thing.

420
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:04,314
<i>Zap!</i>

421
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:06,247
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

422
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,247
Sorry!

423
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:12,929
How much longer can I keep
lying about who really I am?

424
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:14,564
I hear that new Spider man is Puerto Rican.

425
00:24:14,588 --> 00:24:16,144
Nahh, he...

426
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,792
he seems more Dominican to me.

427
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:21,078
-I mean, would they get it if I told them?

428
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,005
We love you and accept you,

429
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,274
even though you have
been lying to us for a year!

430
00:24:27,735 --> 00:24:29,168
Maybe in some other universe.

431
00:24:29,896 --> 00:24:31,543
Sometimes I just...

432
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,136
wish I wasn't the only one.

433
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:35,794
I don't dwell on it.

434
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:44,916
I miss my uncle, sometimes.

435
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,201
Miles, I see exactly
what you're doing here.

436
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:51,845
Even though he... turned
out to be the Prowler.

437
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,970
I try to do what he told me.

438
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:58,810
Just keep going.

439
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,807
You're looking at your texts?

440
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,405
You understand this is
the fight of our lives, right?

441
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:02,945
Sorry, sorry.

442
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,059
- Just... just a second.
- Oh, okay.

443
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:05,835
No, no, no. No, go ahead. Take one call.

444
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,234
You turn off your phone at a movie theater, but
you don't turn it off when you're fighting me?

445
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:09,041
One sec.

446
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:10,051
Ah! "In a minute".

447
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,135
Ahh, he wrote it all as one word.

448
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,037
That's cute, right? Youth.

449
00:25:17,898 --> 00:25:19,731
Ohhh, my nose!

450
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:20,767
Sorry, I just-

451
00:25:20,792 --> 00:25:21,704
I really gotta be somewhere-

452
00:25:21,729 --> 00:25:22,729
Sike.

453
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:26,922
Heh. There's bubbles now. Hold on.

454
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:27,947
Whoa!

455
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,389
I think this is going great!

456
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,053
Still bubbles on here.

457
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,905
You know, I think it's probably okay.

458
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:39,980
We're figuring it out!
We're finding our rhythm!

459
00:25:42,469 --> 00:25:45,423
I've been waiting for this
moment for a really long time, so...

460
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:47,982
Hey, where'd the goose come from?

461
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:49,543
-Whoa!

462
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,497
I don't think I want this costume anymore.

463
00:25:51,522 --> 00:25:54,863
Almost there, Mami... smiley face...

464
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:56,849
Great. Is this your goose?

465
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:58,537
Get it off me, get it off me, get it...

466
00:26:00,833 --> 00:26:01,833
Ow!

467
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:04,213
At the end of the day,

468
00:26:05,836 --> 00:26:07,356
I got you right where I-

469
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:08,381
<i>ow!</i>

470
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:10,876
-I'm Spider man.

471
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:13,683
- No one can take that away from me.
- Unbelievable.

472
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,082
Come back here, nemesis!

473
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,379
Don't escape!

474
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:18,492
Your costume's too tight
in the back, by the way!

475
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:28,340
Yo, what's up, man?

476
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:29,616
Umm, writing an essay.

477
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:32,755
There's a bad guy on the roof of the
Peterson building. Can you call the police?

478
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:35,234
- Tell them to pick him up?
- I dunno. Sounds like a slippery slope.

479
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,047
Just this one time?

480
00:26:36,072 --> 00:26:39,719
It <i>starts</i> with one call, then it's walkie
talkies and synchronized watches...

481
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,261
in a month, it'll be a spider signal...

482
00:26:41,285 --> 00:26:43,146
I'm not your guy in the chair.

483
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:44,607
Are those my Jordans?

484
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:47,043
I can't help it if we're the same size.

485
00:26:58,593 --> 00:27:01,900
You see, every person is a universe.

486
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:05,401
And my job is to capture
your person's universe

487
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:07,141
on this piece of paper.

488
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:09,398
That's blank.

489
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:10,423
Exactly.

490
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,712
I have no idea who this kid is.

491
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:15,587
I don't know if <i>he</i> knows.

492
00:27:15,612 --> 00:27:19,432
And he's gotta decide if he's
gonna commit himself to his future,

493
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:22,605
...or whatever he's doing
instead of being here.

494
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,564
Can't have your cake and eat it, too.

495
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:25,879
Unless you bake two cakes!

496
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:26,653
Miles? <i>Miles!</i>

497
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,145
Interest in comedy.

498
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,748
How's this going?

499
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,650
- Now, son, what have we always said?
- College! Woo-woo!

500
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:32,963
On time means five minutes early.

501
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,682
I know! I know, I know, I know. Look.

502
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,737
I gotta get back to being a great
student, so can we make this quick?

503
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:42,276
Okay.

504
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:44,421
Miles' grades are pretty good.

505
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:46,153
A in AP physics,

506
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:47,459
That's my little man!

507
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,450
And AP studio art,

508
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:51,016
He takes after his uncle.

509
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,310
-A-in English,

510
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:53,011
He's a tough grader.

511
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:54,543
And a B in Spanish.

512
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:56,024
- What?!
- Whoo, okay.

513
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,925
- <i>Miles.</i>
- Are you trying to kill your mother?!

514
00:27:57,949 --> 00:27:59,119
<i>Calm ate, Mami.</i>

515
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:00,446
<i>Eso no es</i> my fault!

516
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,237
"My fault"?

517
00:28:02,262 --> 00:28:03,461
Spanglish!

518
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,980
Mom, I just missed a few classes!

519
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:07,118
Oh, just a few classes.
Well, what's "a few"?

520
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,782
I mean, you know, like...

521
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,026
...five?

522
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:11,051
<i>Five?!</i>

523
00:28:11,284 --> 00:28:12,150
Actually, six.

524
00:28:12,175 --> 00:28:12,820
You're dead.

525
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:13,594
Mom.

526
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,204
- He takes after his uncle.
- Wait, wait, wait. But...

527
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:15,780
But I...

528
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:17,355
- I just have a lot going on.
- Alright.

529
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:19,125
We can still salvage this.

530
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:19,941
I'm sorry, "salvage"?

531
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:22,174
Miles has a great story to tell.

532
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,557
Having a story at all seems gross.

533
00:28:24,582 --> 00:28:26,911
Your name is <i>Miles Morales.</i>

534
00:28:26,936 --> 00:28:27,405
Correct.

535
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,459
You grew up in a
struggling immigrant family.

536
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:33,000
I'm from Puerto Rico. Puerto
Rico's part of America...

537
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,714
We own a fort in Brooklyn. I-I
don't know about <i>struggling</i>...

538
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:37,812
It doesn't matter. You're all struggling.

539
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:38,671
I'll be captain next week.

540
00:28:38,696 --> 00:28:42,570
And now, his dream is to attend
the top physics program in the nation!

541
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,152
Whatever it takes, we'll do it!

542
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:46,539
At <i>Princeton University.</i>

543
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:48,512
In <i>New Jersey?!</i>

544
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,440
No, no, no no no no! That's too far!

545
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:54,056
New Jersey's too far from New York?!

546
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:56,378
There's great schools in Brooklyn!

547
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:59,299
Princeton has the best quantum
researchers in the country!

548
00:28:59,324 --> 00:29:00,550
Quantum research... mm-hmm.

549
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:03,079
They're moving electrons
across dimensional thresholds!

550
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,766
...Electrons, uh-huh.

551
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,406
I mean, they're studying dark matter!

552
00:29:05,431 --> 00:29:07,206
Yeah, I don't know what any of that means.

553
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:10,545
I could help figure out how
to travel to other dimensions.

554
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,340
Yeah, okay.

555
00:29:11,365 --> 00:29:13,600
Oh, yeah. That sounds
like a really good fake job.

556
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,473
Dad. When you were my age,

557
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:18,857
you followed <i>your dream,</i>
and went out on <i>your own,</i>

558
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,649
to start a business with Uncle Aaron.

559
00:29:20,674 --> 00:29:22,330
- Right?
- That's... different.

560
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,470
We used to... see, when you were born,

561
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,290
plus your mom used to...

562
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:28,953
Look, life is a journey.

563
00:29:28,978 --> 00:29:32,497
You all got me into this school 'cuz
you thought I could do something special.

564
00:29:33,796 --> 00:29:35,549
And now, I think so, too.

565
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:38,279
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

566
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,121
There are people
out there who can

567
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:43,507
literally teach me the
things I wanna learn.

568
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,942
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

569
00:29:55,137 --> 00:29:56,557
That's your story!

570
00:29:57,111 --> 00:29:59,956
- Now, just stick to the script.
- Miles, you okay?

571
00:30:05,694 --> 00:30:07,181
- Ooh, I gotta go.
- You...

572
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:08,566
You guys just keep talking!

573
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,121
- This is all great stuff!
- Miles, wait!

574
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:11,468
Did you order the cake for tonight?

575
00:30:11,492 --> 00:30:12,995
Yeah, totally! I'm...
you know, call me! Uhh-

576
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,424
I gotta go. Alright? Uhh... bye!

577
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,406
This kid.

578
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:17,766
I swear. What are we gonna do with him?

579
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,814
<i>All units,</i>

580
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,370
- <i>super villain event over on...</i>
- I-I gotta go.

581
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:20,943
What?!

582
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:21,792
You're gonna leave, too-?

583
00:30:21,817 --> 00:30:22,973
You leave... everybody leaves.

584
00:30:22,997 --> 00:30:24,238
Why am I here?

585
00:30:24,263 --> 00:30:25,611
- Why am I here? Why am I still here?
- I know. I'm so sorry.

586
00:30:25,635 --> 00:30:26,725
But we'll figure it out.

587
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,725
Together.

588
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:31,391
Wow.

589
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,578
Excuse me. I-I'm so sorry.

590
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:34,919
He's lying to you.

591
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:35,646
Jeff?

592
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:36,671
Your son.

593
00:30:36,926 --> 00:30:39,720
He's lying. And I think you know it.

594
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,190
How's your essay?

595
00:30:43,215 --> 00:30:44,046
Marinating.

596
00:30:44,071 --> 00:30:45,531
This is part of my process.

597
00:30:45,556 --> 00:30:46,596
Oh. Oh, really?

598
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:48,126
I think your guy got away.

599
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:48,916
Thanks. I'm on it.

600
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,357
Yeah, you seem really stressed.

601
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:50,863
I agree!

602
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:51,855
- You're stretched
too thin. I've been

603
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,023
worried... Yeah, alright.
Thanks for the tip!

604
00:30:53,047 --> 00:30:53,712
C'mere!

605
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:55,114
- That was bad.
- I know.

606
00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:56,728
What is really going on with this kid?

607
00:30:56,753 --> 00:30:57,577
I don't know!

608
00:30:57,602 --> 00:30:58,602
Hey!

609
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,624
- Spider man!
- Officer Morales!

610
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:01,755
I mean, umm...

611
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,795
Officer Morales.

612
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,060
This is not what it looks like.

613
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:05,744
Hey! Hey!

614
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:08,102
- Officer...!
- My kid goes here, man!

615
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:09,415
Yo!

616
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:10,783
I'm on the PTA!

617
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:12,873
You know how many lemon
bars I gotta bake for that?

618
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:14,405
Who laughs in the middle of a fight?

619
00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:15,104
I did not!

620
00:31:15,129 --> 00:31:16,459
It was...
- Are you serious?!

621
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:18,105
It was inconsiderate
and super rude!

622
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,290
...And a little cocky... oof!

623
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,921
Yeah, you got me agreeing
with the bad guy right now.

624
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,583
Bad guy? He's barely a villain of the week!

625
00:31:24,608 --> 00:31:25,489
What'd you call me?

626
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:27,754
- You realize I'm right here.
- C'mon, man! - Everything-

627
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,270
...is under control!

628
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,973
Of course we'd end up back here.

629
00:31:38,107 --> 00:31:40,294
-Well, you know what?
You are just like my son!

630
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:43,518
-I am? I... That's so silly! I... what?

631
00:31:43,543 --> 00:31:45,843
- <i>Imagine that.</i>
- Back... where it all...

632
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:46,947
- started!
- Watch out!

633
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,509
The crucible of our connection!

634
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,784
Hey, don't try to wow me with big words.

635
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:56,581
-I do the crossword every day.

636
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,155
- Is it all coming back to you?
- What are you talking about?

637
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,712
The creation event!

638
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:08,397
What?

639
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,135
Ah!

640
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:12,360
Yeah?

641
00:32:12,385 --> 00:32:13,445
Hey, baby. We got cut off.

642
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:17,323
Nothing is more important than management.

643
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:23,202
Yeah, I'm kinda in the middle of something.

644
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,039
Destiny brought us here!

645
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,711
You see now, don't you?

646
00:32:28,008 --> 00:32:29,142
I-I really don't.

647
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,877
I <i>am</i> your nemesis.

648
00:32:30,902 --> 00:32:32,614
You're not my nemesis.

649
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:33,843
You missed!

650
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,714
-Can't contain the Spot... augh!

651
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,668
You really don't remember
what you did to me?

652
00:32:39,114 --> 00:32:40,028
-What I did for <i>you?</i>

653
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:40,959
Uhhh...

654
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:41,470
No.

655
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:42,892
I worked at Alchemax.

656
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,441
I ran a test on this collider

657
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:48,036
that brought a spider here
from another dimension.

658
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,632
- 42.
- Its home dimension...

659
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
It escaped.

660
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:54,243
And it bit <i>you.</i>

661
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:57,951
My spider made you Spider man!

662
00:32:58,675 --> 00:32:59,277
What?

663
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:00,795
You ran through the cafeteria.

664
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,432
He took a bagel!

665
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:02,785
You hit me with a bagel!

666
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,108
I've hit a lot of different villains
with a lot of different food!

667
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:10,382
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

668
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:11,757
and everyone loves them.

669
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:14,233
But no one knows what it feels like...

670
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:16,594
to be on the other side of them.

671
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,199
I'm just trying to lighten
the mood, y'know...?

672
00:33:18,223 --> 00:33:19,324
I created you!

673
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,390
And you created me.

674
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,125
Spider man, why did you create that guy?

675
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:24,115
I-I didn't!

676
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,260
He's talking crazy!

677
00:33:25,285 --> 00:33:27,986
I was in this collider
room when you <i>blew it up!</i>

678
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,930
-Because of you,

679
00:33:38,904 --> 00:33:40,700
I lost my job,

680
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:41,725
my life...

681
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:43,611
my <i>face!</i>

682
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:45,853
My family won't even look at me!

683
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:47,585
I made you into a hero!

684
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:49,069
You made me into <i>this!</i>

685
00:33:49,657 --> 00:33:50,708
<i>Look at me!</i>

686
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:53,107
You did this to me!

687
00:33:53,132 --> 00:33:54,345
Look at me!

688
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,032
I'll make you respect me!

689
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:57,674
<i>Yaah! Ahh! Ow!</i>

690
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:00,598
I am your...

691
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,341
nemesis...!

692
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,366
Well, what...

693
00:34:07,391 --> 00:34:08,107
where'd he go?

694
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:10,557
He... kicked his own butt.

695
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:14,158
You know we're supposed to
<i>catch</i> 'em, the bad guys. Right?

696
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:15,666
I always do!

697
00:34:16,468 --> 00:34:17,468
...Usually.

698
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:19,451
Gutierrez, get the crane, man!

699
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,274
Yes, sir!

700
00:34:20,286 --> 00:34:22,714
Ohh, this here is why
nobody likes us, man.

701
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,641
Us...?

702
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:25,746
I am <i>trying</i> to do right out here.

703
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,084
I mean... I'm trying, too-!

704
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,749
- And you need to be a better role model.
- I'm a great role model!

705
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:34,957
Hey, Gutierrez.

706
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,617
You can cancel the crane.

707
00:34:39,215 --> 00:34:41,689
I swear...

708
00:34:41,952 --> 00:34:43,392
Uhhh...

709
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:45,481
Do you wanna talk about it...?

710
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:46,579
Are you crazy?!

711
00:34:46,925 --> 00:34:50,045
Well, men of your generation
ignore their mental health too much.

712
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,648
What am I... what am I even doing?

713
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:56,193
'Cuz no matter what I do,
someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

714
00:34:58,394 --> 00:34:59,460
I know the feeling.

715
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,574
So... your son!

716
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,088
How's he doing?

717
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:09,100
You think he's gonna figure it all out?

718
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,462
Honestly?

719
00:35:10,487 --> 00:35:11,720
Yeah...

720
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:12,700
He's a good kid...

721
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:13,193
Yeah?

722
00:35:13,218 --> 00:35:15,984
Y'know, it's scary. He says
these things that are so smart,

723
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:17,877
-Cool! Well, I should probably-

724
00:35:17,902 --> 00:35:21,073
...and he does these
things that are so <i>stupid.</i>

725
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,032
I just don't want him to mess it up.

726
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,513
Maybe get off the kid's ass.

727
00:35:26,538 --> 00:35:26,936
I'm sorry, <i>what?</i>

728
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,068
What? What... I... I don't know!

729
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:32,524
And I hate that he's not
being honest with me!

730
00:35:32,914 --> 00:35:34,461
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

731
00:35:34,486 --> 00:35:36,793
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?!

732
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:38,940
Uhh... I don't... I don't know.

733
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:40,025
It's just...

734
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:42,891
you're getting pretty good
at being a parent, you think...

735
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:43,915
you got it lit.

736
00:35:44,646 --> 00:35:45,866
And then they go and grow up.

737
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:51,099
I just don't wanna lose him. Y'know?

738
00:35:58,644 --> 00:35:59,984
Well...

739
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:03,268
as an objective observer
with no skin in the game,

740
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,219
I say...

741
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,990
you gotta let him spread his wings, man.

742
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,089
Like this.

743
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,527
...Yeah.

744
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,474
I don't know.

745
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,314
If this isn't nice... what is?

746
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:28,864
I should go.

747
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:32,439
Yeah, and... and catch that holes guy.

748
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:33,727
Don't worry.

749
00:36:33,752 --> 00:36:35,821
I don't think that guy's
gonna show his face again.

750
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:37,871
What?

751
00:36:38,676 --> 00:36:39,676
Okay...

752
00:36:41,346 --> 00:36:42,876
I think I kicked myself...

753
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,761
...into myself.

754
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:48,255
Well, this is new.

755
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,139
Helloooo...!

756
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,983
Hello! Echo, echo, echo... no echo.

757
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:54,501
Hypothesis:

758
00:36:55,401 --> 00:36:57,128
I'm going to put my head in that hole.

759
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:06,952
Ow! Ow, ow, ow! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

760
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:09,653
That was...

761
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:11,353
cool!

762
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:14,914
My holes can take me anywhere.

763
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Excuse me!

764
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:25,078
Hi.

765
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:26,991
Sorry to bug you, I
know you're busy, sorry.

766
00:37:27,016 --> 00:37:27,616
What do you want?

767
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:29,237
I know it's weird, I just
came out of nowhere,

768
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:32,287
but I think I'm becoming a
trans-dimensional super being.

769
00:37:32,312 --> 00:37:32,861
So?

770
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:33,680
-<i>So?</i>

771
00:37:33,705 --> 00:37:37,423
I'm literally splitting the
fabric of space and time!

772
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:39,549
For you, it's just a Tuesday night.

773
00:37:39,861 --> 00:37:42,622
You're acting like weird stuff like
this happens to you all the time.

774
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:45,273
Can I have some gum?

775
00:37:45,298 --> 00:37:46,741
Ahhh, whoa!

776
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:50,635
Wow.

777
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,076
The power of the multiverse
in the palm of my hand.

778
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:56,903
My holes aren't a curse!

779
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:58,064
They're the answer!

780
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,197
Can you stop talking about your holes?

781
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:01,855
You're making everyone
uncomfortable over here.

782
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,999
No, no, no! You're gonna
love this. Look, look, look.

783
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,560
I'm outta spots. Wouldn't ya know it?

784
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,143
Uhh...

785
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:11,361
As you were, gentlemen.

786
00:38:12,087 --> 00:38:14,079
I'm coming for you, Spider man!

787
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:21,783
Oh no.

788
00:38:21,808 --> 00:38:22,794
Tomorrow morning, Spider man.

789
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:24,060
Page one with a
decent picture this time!

790
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:25,410
Uh-huh. Yeah,
absolutely right, boss. I'm...

791
00:38:25,434 --> 00:38:25,749
Shut up.

792
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:26,229
Uh-huh.

793
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,247
- Get outta here!
- You got it, boss.

794
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,314
I'm on it!

795
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,996
God, I need a raise.

796
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:33,125
Beep, beep!

797
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,386
Miguel, it's Peter.

798
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:35,907
We got an anomaly.

799
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:37,619
Thank you, Peter. You're one of our best.

800
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:38,884
Jess? Who's on this?

801
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:39,909
Beep, beep.

802
00:38:53,649 --> 00:38:54,539
Have you seen Miles?

803
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:55,564
Nope.

804
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:56,961
Hey!

805
00:38:57,577 --> 00:38:58,431
What about Miles?

806
00:38:58,456 --> 00:38:59,456
Nope.

807
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:00,907
Have you seen Miles?

808
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,040
- What are you doing?
- Well?

809
00:39:04,064 --> 00:39:06,386
- Speech! Okay, everybody!
- What? No!

810
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,359
<i>Todos!</i>

811
00:39:08,384 --> 00:39:10,224
- Oh, dear God, no.
- It's time for the speech!

812
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,729
Rio, come on.

813
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:14,418
Ummm...

814
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:15,557
Hi.

815
00:39:15,582 --> 00:39:17,640
"And I want you to know, no matter what,

816
00:39:17,665 --> 00:39:19,640
even though we've had our ups and downs,

817
00:39:19,665 --> 00:39:21,350
I am so proud of you today!

818
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,034
- And every day! "Parenthesis," mostly.
- Hey. Umm, hey.

819
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:26,222
- "LOL". Heh. "PS..."
- Hey, Mr. Spider man.

820
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,801
It won't fit on one cake.

821
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:31,575
Can't you write smaller?

822
00:39:32,297 --> 00:39:33,764
Can't you write shorter?

823
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:36,717
Come again!

824
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:39,369
Uhhh, what else can I say about Jeff?

825
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:42,947
That he was <i>almost</i> ten pounds as a baby!

826
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:44,492
I know, I know! You're gonna be
embarrassed. You're gonna be...

827
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:47,155
...he almost killed his
mother. Look at those shoulders.

828
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,720
Oh, no. Okay, okay,
okay, that's it, okay.

829
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:49,457
He was a big baby.

830
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:51,742
- Oh my God!
- Okay.

831
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:52,697
Oh, he's so funny!

832
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:55,016
Ohh, I'll take the mic.
No more mics for you.

833
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,819
- Thank you Rio, for that.
- Where is that kid?

834
00:39:57,844 --> 00:40:00,689
- You know, I didn't always
know what I wanted to do in life.

835
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:04,514
-I was pulled in a lot of different
directions when I was young.

836
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,555
-You know, me and my brother
came up in this neighborhood,

837
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:10,005
-just a couple of knuckleheads
running the streets.

838
00:40:12,689 --> 00:40:14,232
You guys used to...

839
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,826
- chase us outta your stores, and now,
- Hey! Taxi!

840
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,876
If you can believe it, it's
my job to look out for you.

841
00:40:18,888 --> 00:40:19,731
Thank you. Thank you.

842
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,761
- And then, I had a kid,
- Be right back!

843
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,187
And everything changed.

844
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:25,798
For the better.

845
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,184
I mean, I don't even know
about giving a toast, 'cuz I...

846
00:40:29,196 --> 00:40:29,867
Hey! Hey! Wait!

847
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,306
-I should be toasting you all.

848
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:35,096
So, to my brother,

849
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:37,372
who we miss every single day.

850
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,218
He's definitely up there
laughing at me, right now.

851
00:40:41,243 --> 00:40:43,043
They're making me captain, bro!

852
00:40:44,588 --> 00:40:46,688
To my wife, <i>mi amor,</i>

853
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:50,119
I can't even start, 'cuz I'll never stop.

854
00:40:50,144 --> 00:40:52,870
You'll have to take the mic from me!

855
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:54,368
And to my son...

856
00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:04,645
The reason that I do any
of this in the first place.

857
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,917
Well, I love you, Miles.

858
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,319
And I will always, <i>always</i> be here for you.

859
00:41:20,107 --> 00:41:21,954
Vinny, man, come on! Drop the beat!

860
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:25,897
I'm gonna kill that kid.

861
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:29,316
- Hey, congrats, Jeff!
- Hey, hey! Hey!

862
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:30,430
Thank you for coming!

863
00:41:49,112 --> 00:41:49,894
Hey, Miles!

864
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:50,919
What's up, man?

865
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:53,333
There you are. You keeping
your head up with that school?

866
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:54,593
Oh, yeah. You bet.

867
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:55,982
<i>¡Hola!</i>

868
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:58,914
Hey! Your parents have
been looking for you.

869
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:01,381
I don't know why, I've just
been here the whole time.

870
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:02,139
- <i>¡Oye!</i>
- Aaah!

871
00:42:02,164 --> 00:42:03,727
- Hi!
- You were supposed to be here at 5.

872
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,629
-I know, I know, I know, but-
-You're disrespecting your dad!

873
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,893
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- Missed his beautiful toast,

874
00:42:07,918 --> 00:42:09,747
Come on, did you even see the cakes?

875
00:42:09,772 --> 00:42:11,574
There's some heartfelt messages on them!

876
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:17,041
That's... not what I meant.

877
00:42:17,066 --> 00:42:19,003
Your dad studied for 8 months.

878
00:42:19,027 --> 00:42:20,026
9!

879
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:20,881
It was like giving birth!

880
00:42:20,906 --> 00:42:21,507
No it wasn't.

881
00:42:21,532 --> 00:42:22,127
Of course not.

882
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:24,424
You made us sit in that office
to talk to that lady without you!

883
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:25,936
<i>Gah,</i> it was an emergency!

884
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,546
What, a graffiti emergency?

885
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:29,617
A party with some friends
I've never met emergency?!

886
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:30,366
Explain yourself.

887
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:32,540
Sounds like
you're explaining it pretty well.

888
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:33,613
Ha. That's funny.

889
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:35,155
Jeff, we have a funny son.

890
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,811
I'm not laughing.

891
00:42:35,836 --> 00:42:39,451
- ¡Hola!
- Hey!

892
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:44,039
- I don't feel grown up.
- Wow, this is a cool shirt!

893
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,182
- Okay! Okay, okay.
- It's like a...

894
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:46,841
You know, have you checked out the...?

895
00:42:49,823 --> 00:42:50,516
<i>¡Oye!</i>

896
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,171
Aahh!

897
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,586
Who are you running around with, anyway?

898
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:53,580
- Just...
- Is it Genki?

899
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:54,437
I never liked him.

900
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:55,334
Yes, you did!

901
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,469
He calls me by my first name.

902
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,536
<i>Ugh.</i> We hate that.

903
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:59,339
I have more friends than just Genki.

904
00:42:59,364 --> 00:42:59,960
Like who?

905
00:43:00,196 --> 00:43:01,549
Well, there's... there's...

906
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:02,049
Peter.

907
00:43:02,526 --> 00:43:03,600
Y'know? Uhh...

908
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:06,409
But he left town, umm... there's...

909
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:07,527
There's Gwanda!

910
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:10,044
Y'know? She... she also... left town...

911
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:11,544
Miles, <i>por favor, dame un</i> break.

912
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:12,615
Is that Spanglish?

913
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:16,648
Has it ever occurred to you
that maybe, I'm just doing...

914
00:43:16,673 --> 00:43:20,415
benign, private, unremarkable
things when I'm not with you guys?

915
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,934
- Nope.
- Never.

916
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,547
I am 15 years old!

917
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:24,732
- I am basically an adult!
- Oh, right! Right.

918
00:43:24,757 --> 00:43:26,397
- You don't even have a driver's license!
- Neither does Mom!

919
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,916
Because we live in New
York, and never plan to leave.

920
00:43:29,218 --> 00:43:31,298
- It's <i>my</i> life!
- It's <i>not</i> your life!

921
00:43:31,682 --> 00:43:34,822
It's mine. And your father's,
and your <i>abuelos y abuelas,</i>

922
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:38,423
who put you in this spot
I'd give <i>anything</i> to be in.

923
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:40,248
Alright, alright. Whatever. Whatever.

924
00:43:43,394 --> 00:43:44,447
<i>Whatever?</i>

925
00:43:44,472 --> 00:43:46,563
- Woooow.
- <i>Whatever?!</i>

926
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:48,287
Do I get to say it?

927
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:49,795
- Please tell me that I can say it.
- Say it.

928
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:50,585
You're grounded!

929
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:50,899
What?

930
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:51,506
Oh, yeah!

931
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:52,293
For how long?

932
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:53,639
- A month!
- Dad!

933
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:54,597
Mom, are you...

934
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:55,334
Seriously?

935
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,559
Yeah! Dead serious!

936
00:43:56,584 --> 00:43:57,446
You don't understand!

937
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,002
You're right! You are right!

938
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:01,667
I have no idea what's going on with you!

939
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:03,981
- So, why don't you tell me?
- Just listen to me!

940
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:05,654
Okay, champ! You got it!

941
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,787
Go for it. Say whatever you wanna say.

942
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,981
What do you got to tell me so bad?!

943
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:21,719
You know what?

944
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:22,744
Never mind.

945
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:27,281
Alright, great. Walk away.

946
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:29,102
Because now you got two months!

947
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,238
That was good, right?

948
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:44,921
Two months.

949
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,817
I'm Spider man.

950
00:44:47,841 --> 00:44:48,869
I'm not grounded.

951
00:45:41,202 --> 00:45:42,202
Miles!

952
00:45:42,733 --> 00:45:43,820
-Miles!

953
00:45:44,899 --> 00:45:45,699
Got a minute?

954
00:45:45,865 --> 00:45:47,352
Whoa! What...

955
00:45:47,546 --> 00:45:49,353
H-how did you get...

956
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:51,886
How did you get-

957
00:45:51,945 --> 00:45:53,012
How have you been?

958
00:45:53,037 --> 00:45:54,712
Uhh... I've been... good.

959
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:56,105
I've been... yeah, just great.

960
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,130
Look at you!

961
00:45:57,347 --> 00:45:59,053
You, uhh... you grew, huh?

962
00:45:59,078 --> 00:46:00,552
- Had a little growth spurt?
- Uhh, yeah.

963
00:46:00,576 --> 00:46:03,144
Your hair has gotten...

964
00:46:03,169 --> 00:46:03,651
pinker.

965
00:46:03,676 --> 00:46:04,725
Is this the room you grew up in?

966
00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:05,417
It is.

967
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:06,880
Umm... but...

968
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,550
My dorm room is... is... very adult.

969
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:11,778
Cool, yeah, no, I used to play
with these when I was younger, too.

970
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:12,709
Uhh, that's...

971
00:46:12,734 --> 00:46:14,220
- that's a... that's a collectible.
- Wow!

972
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:15,790
- I used to have this one!
- Actually, that's an

973
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,814
- extremely rare... highly sought-after...
- Why is it still in the package?

974
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:20,058
Um...

975
00:46:21,405 --> 00:46:22,772
That's fine.

976
00:46:24,391 --> 00:46:25,445
- Hey!
- Are these your drawings?

977
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:27,282
- What? No.
- Wow, they're good!

978
00:46:29,374 --> 00:46:30,414
Wow, there's...

979
00:46:30,439 --> 00:46:32,168
so... many...

980
00:46:32,872 --> 00:46:35,326
Missed you, too.

981
00:46:36,372 --> 00:46:37,319
So...

982
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:38,829
what are you doing here?

983
00:46:38,854 --> 00:46:41,254
I-I mean, I... thought I'd...

984
00:46:41,279 --> 00:46:42,486
never see you again.

985
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
Wanna get outta here?

986
00:46:45,823 --> 00:46:47,863
I'm... grounded.

987
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,089
Bummer.

988
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,119
Is Spider man grounded?

989
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:56,811
Uhhh...

990
00:46:58,799 --> 00:46:59,799
I mean, I-

991
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:07,390
Miles?

992
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:09,989
Your dad's ready to listen now.

993
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:19,025
That's <i>three</i> months!

994
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:21,810
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

995
00:47:22,267 --> 00:47:25,880
There's an elite society with
all the best Spider people in it?

996
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:27,115
Okay, so there's this lady.

997
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,209
-Jess Drew. She rides a motorcycle,
-Uh-huh?

998
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:29,774
A motorcycle?

999
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:31,439
Oh my gosh, I'm
learning <i>so much</i> from her!

1000
00:47:31,463 --> 00:47:33,619
Oh, yeah, I've... I've
learned a lot of stuff, too.

1001
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:35,530
I've leveled up my whole thing!

1002
00:47:35,871 --> 00:47:36,418
See?

1003
00:47:36,443 --> 00:47:38,453
- Eh?
- Oh, yeah? Let's see it, then.

1004
00:47:38,478 --> 00:47:39,407
Let's go!

1005
00:47:39,432 --> 00:47:40,432
Thread the needle!

1006
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:45,859
Whoa!

1007
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:49,895
Easy!

1008
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:51,421
And Miguel.

1009
00:47:51,446 --> 00:47:53,573
The whole thing was his idea.

1010
00:47:53,598 --> 00:47:55,202
And... who's Miguel?

1011
00:47:55,227 --> 00:47:58,782
Oh, he's like a... ninja, vampire
Spider man, but a good guy?

1012
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:00,395
A vampire good guy!

1013
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,036
I'd pay good money to see that.

1014
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:03,851
So, how long ago did they invite you?

1015
00:48:03,876 --> 00:48:06,089
Uh, only, like... a few months ago.

1016
00:48:06,114 --> 00:48:07,914
"Months" is kind of a long time, isn't it?

1017
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:09,486
Okay, this one counts as two.

1018
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:14,841
Whooo!

1019
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:17,845
Look at you.

1020
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:19,278
Look at me!

1021
00:48:20,844 --> 00:48:21,844
Keep the change!

1022
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:23,276
So, this club...

1023
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:24,360
Look at that dumb-dumb.

1024
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:25,506
...What kind of stuff do you do?

1025
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,773
Guy in the stripes. Ten points.

1026
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:29,559
We're trying to keep the
multiverse from collapsing.

1027
00:48:29,808 --> 00:48:31,190
I thought we did that already.

1028
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:33,711
Like, last week we had this mission
to some Shakespeare dimension,

1029
00:48:33,735 --> 00:48:34,057
What?

1030
00:48:34,082 --> 00:48:35,898
- And Hobie and I just, like...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1031
00:48:35,922 --> 00:48:37,630
- Who... who's Hobie?
- Oh my gosh,

1032
00:48:37,655 --> 00:48:38,938
you would love him!

1033
00:48:38,963 --> 00:48:40,695
He lets me crash in his
dimension sometimes.

1034
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:43,221
Hey, what does that mean?
You stay overnight, or...?

1035
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:46,293
Anyway, listen, they're... they're pretty
strict about where I go, or I...

1036
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:48,090
I really would've come to see you sooner.

1037
00:48:48,115 --> 00:48:48,940
Right...

1038
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:49,725
so, uhh...

1039
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,379
so... so why'd you come now?

1040
00:48:51,404 --> 00:48:53,275
Don't... don't do that.

1041
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,300
Ah!

1042
00:48:56,411 --> 00:48:57,271
Hey, Gw-...

1043
00:48:57,296 --> 00:48:58,789
uhh... Gwen?

1044
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:00,738
Where'd you go?

1045
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:04,826
Where'd she go...?

1046
00:49:16,974 --> 00:49:17,741
Ah!

1047
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:19,245
Oh, hey. There you are.

1048
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,068
What are you doing?

1049
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,093
Waitin' for you.

1050
00:49:38,004 --> 00:49:39,457
This is a cool thinking spot.

1051
00:49:39,482 --> 00:49:40,011
Right?

1052
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,704
I mean, who needs a treadmill when
you have the Williamsburg Bank building?

1053
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,354
So, uhh... you and your dad.

1054
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:51,268
You still haven't talked?

1055
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,920
What exactly would we talk about?

1056
00:49:54,945 --> 00:49:56,791
"Hey, Dad. How's the last few months been?"

1057
00:49:58,084 --> 00:50:00,101
"You still think I
murdered my best friend?"

1058
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:03,570
Oh.

1059
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:05,324
I mean, my parents...

1060
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:06,976
I mean, maybe if I told them-

1061
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:08,001
<i>Don't.</i>

1062
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:09,906
Trust me on that.

1063
00:50:26,161 --> 00:50:27,161
Well...

1064
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:31,644
Maybe, some things are
supposed to be just for us.

1065
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:34,452
Hmm.

1066
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:37,737
That's a nice way to think about it.

1067
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,623
I'm just... a really
emotionally intelligent guy.

1068
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,618
Beyond my years.

1069
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:50,162
You know, it really is
always so great to talk to you.

1070
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:51,741
Yeah?

1071
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Yeah.

1072
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:57,519
I mean... how many people
can you talk to about this stuff?

1073
00:50:59,066 --> 00:51:00,252
You don't even know.

1074
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:05,595
What?

1075
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:10,578
You're the only friend I've ever
really made, after Peter died.

1076
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,402
...Other than Hobie. Right?

1077
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,506
That's different.

1078
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:18,851
Yeah? How's that?

1079
00:51:19,204 --> 00:51:20,857
I don't know. You...

1080
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:23,522
and me... it's...

1081
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,115
We're... the same.

1082
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:29,408
In the important ways.

1083
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:31,143
Y'know?

1084
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:37,314
In every other universe,
Gwen Stacy falls for Spider man.

1085
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:46,657
And in every other universe...

1086
00:51:47,203 --> 00:51:48,806
it doesn't end well.

1087
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,311
Well...

1088
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:03,700
there's a first time for everything, right?

1089
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,507
Mmm!

1090
00:52:25,721 --> 00:52:26,808
Oh, wow.

1091
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,427
Feelings make me hungry.

1092
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:29,087
Oh, yeah.

1093
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,328
These plátanos are just deep fried filling.

1094
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:35,092
She looks old enough to vote.

1095
00:52:36,505 --> 00:52:38,571
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

1096
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:43,778
This keeps you from
glitching in other dimensions?

1097
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:44,705
-Yeah. It's pretty cool.

1098
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:47,727
What's it gonna take for Miguel
O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

1099
00:52:47,752 --> 00:52:50,280
I'll put in a good word.

1100
00:52:50,305 --> 00:52:52,923
I'm just saying. If I had a
watch, I could come with you.

1101
00:52:52,948 --> 00:52:53,710
Miles...

1102
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,250
- Look...
- I <i>did</i> save the multiverse!

1103
00:52:55,275 --> 00:52:57,314
It's a... really small,
elite strike force...

1104
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:59,219
I can turn invisible, I
have like, electric powers...

1105
00:52:59,231 --> 00:52:59,861
There's just-

1106
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,765
- There aren't a lot of slots.
- Think about it!

1107
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:04,855
Uh-huh. Right.

1108
00:53:05,554 --> 00:53:08,528
-Look, if it was up to me, you-
-Oh, I know. I know.

1109
00:53:11,363 --> 00:53:13,658
Oh, no! No, no, no! Don't do that! Miles!

1110
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:16,377
- Alright. Jeez.
- It's, uhh... it's really delicate.

1111
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,888
Sorry. Didn't mean to, um... snap.

1112
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:22,957
Okay. Alright. I'm sorry.

1113
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:24,172
Helloooo!

1114
00:53:24,197 --> 00:53:26,912
- Hi. I'm Miles' mom.
- Oh, boy.

1115
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,223
Rio! Hi!

1116
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,949
I've heard so much about you!

1117
00:53:29,974 --> 00:53:32,001
Huh. You're using my first name. Okay!

1118
00:53:32,026 --> 00:53:34,426
This is nice. We found
it in Miles' room, so...

1119
00:53:35,064 --> 00:53:37,211
I guess you must've been there. Huh?

1120
00:53:37,236 --> 00:53:38,082
And you must be Jeff.

1121
00:53:38,107 --> 00:53:40,525
She called me Jeff. Heh, seriously. Jeff.

1122
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,678
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

1123
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:44,775
Soon to be <i>Captain</i> Morales.

1124
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,481
Ah! Captain.

1125
00:53:47,962 --> 00:53:50,982
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

1126
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:52,462
Yeah, yeah. We were just catching up.

1127
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:53,613
Ohhh.

1128
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:54,600
Don't take him from me!

1129
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,333
Mom!

1130
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,219
I'm just kidding. He's
grounded, so you can't.

1131
00:53:59,407 --> 00:54:00,633
- Don't break his heart.
- <i>Mom!</i>

1132
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:01,829
Shoot!

1133
00:54:01,854 --> 00:54:02,985
Shoot, I have to go.

1134
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:03,699
Really?

1135
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:06,299
Yeah, I, uh... forgot to get my steps in!

1136
00:54:06,324 --> 00:54:08,454
Uhh, really... really
wish I could stay longer.

1137
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:09,707
I, uh... I'm sorry.

1138
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:11,618
Goodbye.

1139
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:16,669
...Yeah. Bye.

1140
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:54,132
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.

1141
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,458
I, um...

1142
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,042
hope I didn't <i>ice your game,</i> man.

1143
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:03,017
No one my age says those
words in that order, Mom.

1144
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:05,311
It's just...

1145
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:09,509
hard, to see my little man
not be my little boy all the time.

1146
00:55:11,143 --> 00:55:12,143
Yeah.

1147
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,472
I hope you know you can tell me anything.

1148
00:55:29,995 --> 00:55:30,995
Well...

1149
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:51,586
I'm...

1150
00:55:58,507 --> 00:55:59,601
I'm sorry I was late.

1151
00:56:09,294 --> 00:56:10,294
Go.

1152
00:56:13,014 --> 00:56:15,234
She seems like a... nice girl.

1153
00:56:17,691 --> 00:56:18,477
Is this a trick?

1154
00:56:18,502 --> 00:56:19,704
It's not a trick.

1155
00:56:20,282 --> 00:56:21,282
Jeez.

1156
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:22,875
What're you...

1157
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,786
Lemme fix you, just...

1158
00:56:25,739 --> 00:56:28,472
well, for years, I've been
taking care of this little boy, right?

1159
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:31,590
Making sure he's loved,

1160
00:56:32,428 --> 00:56:35,881
that he feels like he belongs
wherever he wants to be,

1161
00:56:37,493 --> 00:56:40,766
he wants to go out into the
world and do great big things...

1162
00:56:42,064 --> 00:56:43,697
and what I worry about most

1163
00:56:45,286 --> 00:56:47,959
is... they won't look out for you, like us.

1164
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,514
They won't root for you, like us.

1165
00:56:54,124 --> 00:56:55,124
So.

1166
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:56,901
Here's the deal.

1167
00:56:58,105 --> 00:56:59,324
Wherever you go from here

1168
00:56:59,348 --> 00:57:02,338
you have to promise to take
care of that little boy for me.

1169
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:05,370
Make sure he never
forgets where he came from.

1170
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:07,649
And...

1171
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,060
he never doubts that he is loved.

1172
00:57:11,316 --> 00:57:13,809
And he never lets <i>anyone</i>

1173
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:16,723
at those big fancy
places he's gonna be in...

1174
00:57:17,426 --> 00:57:20,293
tell him that he doesn't belong there.

1175
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:24,286
And when he comes home... and
he'd <i>better</i> come home!

1176
00:57:26,737 --> 00:57:27,938
You're gonna be early,

1177
00:57:28,664 --> 00:57:31,490
and you're gonna be
holding a normal, nice cake.

1178
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,335
Yeah, okay.

1179
00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:35,448
You gotta promise, Miles.

1180
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:37,151
I promise.

1181
00:57:38,152 --> 00:57:39,152
Just...

1182
00:57:40,762 --> 00:57:41,807
don't get lost.

1183
00:57:41,832 --> 00:57:43,115
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1184
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,140
<i>¿Me oyes?</i>

1185
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:45,602
Alright!

1186
00:57:46,678 --> 00:57:47,678
Cool.

1187
00:57:56,317 --> 00:57:57,837
Now, get... go. Get outta here.

1188
00:58:01,175 --> 00:58:03,015
But when you come
back, you're still grounded.

1189
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:06,248
Yeah, I'm smiling like
it's a joke, but it's true.

1190
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,869
Yeah, I-I figured.

1191
00:58:08,669 --> 00:58:09,669
See you later.

1192
00:58:10,651 --> 00:58:11,651
With a cake.

1193
00:59:03,015 --> 00:59:04,015
Shoot.

1194
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:09,085
Whoa, hey, hey, hey! The car!

1195
00:59:18,456 --> 00:59:19,689
Aw, shoot.

1196
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:31,806
Oh, shoot, shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot...

1197
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,827
Show me what happened.

1198
00:59:41,852 --> 00:59:42,766
Replay commencing.

1199
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:43,828
...spots! That's the thing.

1200
00:59:43,852 --> 00:59:45,790
I need more spots!

1201
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,422
Oh, my God! It was right under where my...

1202
00:59:48,447 --> 00:59:50,695
my nose would've been! I just...

1203
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,380
need a little bit more
dimensional juice, or whatever.

1204
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:53,744
Shoot!

1205
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:54,809
Never did come up
with a cool name for that...

1206
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:56,400
Branding was never my strong suit.

1207
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:58,891
...power line to my
micro-collider...prototype,

1208
00:59:58,916 --> 01:00:01,578
could generate a little more
concentrated dark energy...

1209
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,779
- This is what I love about heists!
- Shoot, shoot!

1210
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:09,540
I just need enough to get me
somewhere with a full-sized collider.

1211
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:12,315
And Spider man...

1212
01:00:12,577 --> 01:00:14,164
I'll make you pay...

1213
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:16,642
for everything you took away from me.

1214
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,520
This should work!

1215
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,825
Or vaporize me and
everything in this building.

1216
01:00:22,931 --> 01:00:23,931
Oh, what the heck?

1217
01:00:24,392 --> 01:00:25,392
Shoot.

1218
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,456
Oh!

1219
01:00:29,322 --> 01:00:30,322
I did it!

1220
01:00:33,388 --> 01:00:34,388
<i>Ow!</i>

1221
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:38,734
Oof...

1222
01:00:45,677 --> 01:00:46,677
Shoot.

1223
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:51,444
Replay complete.

1224
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:53,898
No! Why, why, why, why, <i>why?!</i>

1225
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:55,882
Gwen, Gwen, Gwen, Gwen-

1226
01:00:55,907 --> 01:00:56,907
Gwen!

1227
01:00:57,092 --> 01:00:57,918
Hi!

1228
01:00:57,943 --> 01:00:59,414
-What'cha doing?

1229
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:00,089
Nothing!

1230
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,542
Uhh... good! All good.

1231
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,409
Yeah, everything's good. Um...

1232
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:04,434
Bye!

1233
01:01:04,867 --> 01:01:07,695
Where's the... the bad guy
you were supposed to monitor?

1234
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,981
Oh, he just stepped out for a moment.

1235
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:09,629
Dude!

1236
01:01:09,654 --> 01:01:11,090
Look, he's just some villain of the week!

1237
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:11,553
Lyla?

1238
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:12,266
Oh, we don't need-

1239
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,506
Tracking...

1240
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:14,454
Oh, hey, look! I got him!

1241
01:01:14,479 --> 01:01:15,821
Nope, never mind.

1242
01:01:15,846 --> 01:01:17,006
Hold on... oh!

1243
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:18,031
Slippery guy.

1244
01:01:18,624 --> 01:01:19,745
Did you go see your little friend?

1245
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:21,465
What? No! Miles?

1246
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:21,891
I mean...

1247
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,585
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Only briefly!

1248
01:01:24,813 --> 01:01:25,480
From afar.

1249
01:01:25,505 --> 01:01:26,300
How far?

1250
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:27,325
Like...

1251
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,386
you know... about this...

1252
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:31,228
- About... this far apart...
- Oh, that's way too close.

1253
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:32,352
Girl!

1254
01:01:32,377 --> 01:01:34,443
I just... look, I had to know how he was!

1255
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:38,134
- I can't... I honestly can't with you.
- Look, I know I messed up, okay?!

1256
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:39,862
- He can't be part of this.
- I...

1257
01:01:39,887 --> 01:01:40,887
-I know.

1258
01:01:41,634 --> 01:01:43,020
I'll never see him again.

1259
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,718
- Alright?
- No kidding!

1260
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,062
Hey, guys? Guys?

1261
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:47,299
He's making his own portals.

1262
01:01:47,324 --> 01:01:48,004
What?

1263
01:01:48,029 --> 01:01:49,229
He can jump wherever he wants.

1264
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,428
-He could be a total canon-killer.

1265
01:01:51,453 --> 01:01:53,092
You said he was a villain of the week!

1266
01:01:53,117 --> 01:01:54,837
Do you know how bad this is for you?

1267
01:01:54,862 --> 01:01:57,070
Every dimension he
stops at has an Alchemax.

1268
01:01:57,095 --> 01:01:57,850
What's he up to, Gwen?

1269
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:58,875
I don't know.

1270
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,057
No, no! Amazing!

1271
01:02:02,082 --> 01:02:03,612
My star pupil, everyone.

1272
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:05,274
I'll get him. Okay?

1273
01:02:05,299 --> 01:02:06,299
I can get backup.

1274
01:02:07,025 --> 01:02:08,445
If Miguel finds out I let you go-

1275
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,726
Don't tell Miguel.

1276
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:11,291
He'll kick me out, and...

1277
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:12,898
what if he sends me home?

1278
01:02:14,915 --> 01:02:15,855
I got him!

1279
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,401
Earth-50101.

1280
01:02:18,145 --> 01:02:19,145
Whaddya wanna do?

1281
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,119
You never made a mistake?

1282
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,628
Never got too close to someone?

1283
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:26,980
I did.

1284
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,457
But I got over it.

1285
01:02:33,162 --> 01:02:34,555
Alert the local Spider,

1286
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,367
- tell him Gwen will meet him there.
- I'm on it.

1287
01:02:36,391 --> 01:02:37,658
-Oh, thank you. Thank you so much,
-Yeah. Okay.

1288
01:02:37,682 --> 01:02:40,402
- I promise I will not let you down again.
- You're welcome. Shut up.

1289
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,947
You got an hour to fix this,

1290
01:02:43,934 --> 01:02:45,120
or I can't help you.

1291
01:03:13,401 --> 01:03:14,401
Goodbye, Miles.

1292
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,437
<i>Ah!</i> Sorry! Sorry!

1293
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:25,757
Whoa!

1294
01:04:25,782 --> 01:04:26,782
Oof!

1295
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:38,970
You see that? This is incredible!

1296
01:04:38,995 --> 01:04:40,332
-I'm like a whole new person!

1297
01:04:40,357 --> 01:04:40,843
Where did you go?

1298
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:42,062
If I were to look in
the mirror right now,

1299
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,236
- Stay still!
- I wouldn't recognize myself,

1300
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,631
but I would envy that
person that was on the end!

1301
01:04:44,643 --> 01:04:45,104
Slow down!

1302
01:04:45,128 --> 01:04:46,271
-I have eyes on the anomaly.

1303
01:04:46,296 --> 01:04:47,132
Try getting <i>hands</i> on.

1304
01:04:47,157 --> 01:04:48,832
Stop hovering. You're literally hovering.

1305
01:04:48,857 --> 01:04:50,392
Hello! Pardon me, locals!

1306
01:04:50,417 --> 01:04:53,042
Wow. Four on there,
wow. That's very dangerous.

1307
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:54,208
That looks good!

1308
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:55,963
Which way to Alchemax... oh!

1309
01:04:55,988 --> 01:04:56,923
Hahh!

1310
01:04:56,948 --> 01:04:59,140
It's a place with a big collider...

1311
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:00,793
Hey, cow spots!

1312
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:01,797
<i>Mooooove</i> over!

1313
01:05:01,822 --> 01:05:02,871
That's the best you can do?

1314
01:05:02,895 --> 01:05:04,436
Gwen! I'm here to help!

1315
01:05:04,461 --> 01:05:05,461
Miles?!

1316
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:06,528
Foot in your face!

1317
01:05:06,553 --> 01:05:08,033
You weren't expecting that, were you?

1318
01:05:08,573 --> 01:05:09,452
Oh, no!

1319
01:05:09,477 --> 01:05:11,366
Neither was I! I'm in the zone!

1320
01:05:11,391 --> 01:05:12,391
<i>Whoo!</i>

1321
01:05:13,924 --> 01:05:14,924
I got you!

1322
01:05:15,101 --> 01:05:16,481
- Did you follow me?!
- No!

1323
01:05:16,506 --> 01:05:19,168
I just saw where you went, and...

1324
01:05:19,193 --> 01:05:20,371
went there without you knowing.

1325
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:21,688
You're not supposed to be here!

1326
01:05:21,713 --> 01:05:23,313
What are you talking about? I'm helping-

1327
01:05:25,383 --> 01:05:25,877
No!

1328
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:28,394
No, no, no no no no no no! No!

1329
01:05:30,683 --> 01:05:31,683
Whoa!

1330
01:05:32,653 --> 01:05:34,173
I shouldn't have <i>ever</i> come to see you.

1331
01:05:34,949 --> 01:05:35,949
Dang.

1332
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:39,681
<i>Hyah!</i>

1333
01:05:40,054 --> 01:05:41,054
<i>Ahh!</i>

1334
01:05:44,687 --> 01:05:46,101
Hey, who's the new guy?

1335
01:05:46,126 --> 01:05:46,862
Hey, Pav.

1336
01:05:46,887 --> 01:05:48,883
He's Miles, and he wasn't invited.

1337
01:05:48,908 --> 01:05:51,800
Oooh, you weren't invited,
and you came anyway?

1338
01:05:51,825 --> 01:05:52,162
Right?

1339
01:05:52,187 --> 01:05:54,554
Hey, new guy must be in love with you.

1340
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:55,613
- No...!
- Okay, whoa.

1341
01:05:55,638 --> 01:05:56,423
I'm not.

1342
01:05:56,448 --> 01:05:57,849
- Oh, I'm very good at reading people.
- No, he's not.

1343
01:05:57,873 --> 01:05:58,417
Who are you?

1344
01:05:58,442 --> 01:05:59,736
I'm glad you asked, new guy!

1345
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:00,925
-I'm not a new guy.

1346
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,342
My name is Pravitr Prabhakar.

1347
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:04,710
And, for the past 6 months,

1348
01:06:04,735 --> 01:06:05,297
<i>Six?</i>

1349
01:06:05,322 --> 01:06:06,610
And even <i>he</i> got a watch?

1350
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:07,271
Yeah, uhh...

1351
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:09,487
Being Spider man is so easy!

1352
01:06:09,512 --> 01:06:11,829
I wake up, skip the workout,
because I'm naturally buff,

1353
01:06:11,854 --> 01:06:13,257
and I don't wanna get too big, you know?

1354
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:15,234
Do almost nothing with my <i>amazing</i> hair,

1355
01:06:15,259 --> 01:06:16,630
You don't use any product at all?

1356
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:18,668
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics...

1357
01:06:18,693 --> 01:06:21,410
Then I swing by school, don't
really have to try, but I do anyway,

1358
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,328
fight a few bad guys,

1359
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:23,535
feed a few street dogs,

1360
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,450
quick break for a cup of
chai with my Maya auntie,

1361
01:06:25,474 --> 01:06:26,491
I love chai tea!

1362
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:27,978
What did you just say...?

1363
01:06:28,189 --> 01:06:29,316
<i>"Chai tea"?</i>

1364
01:06:29,341 --> 01:06:31,231
- "Chai" means tea, bro!
- Oh.

1365
01:06:31,256 --> 01:06:32,551
- You're saying "tea tea!"
- Oh, umm... uh...

1366
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,653
Would I ask you for a "coffee coffee"?

1367
01:06:33,677 --> 01:06:35,320
- Hmm? Or "cream cream"?
- I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

1368
01:06:35,344 --> 01:06:36,010
I'm so sorry.

1369
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:38,792
-Then, I hang out with
my girlfriend, <i>Gayatri.</i>

1370
01:06:38,817 --> 01:06:41,222
-She's an extremely classy teenager.

1371
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:43,701
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking...

1372
01:06:43,726 --> 01:06:45,593
Ah, hello, police inspector Singh!

1373
01:06:45,618 --> 01:06:47,604
-This is your daughter, I do <i>not</i> know her.

1374
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:48,719
-And to top it off,

1375
01:06:48,744 --> 01:06:51,259
I live in the best
possible Spider man city,

1376
01:06:51,284 --> 01:06:52,033
Mum bat tan.

1377
01:06:52,058 --> 01:06:52,631
Quick tour.

1378
01:06:52,656 --> 01:06:53,548
This is where the traffic is,

1379
01:06:53,573 --> 01:06:54,224
this is where the traffic is,

1380
01:06:54,249 --> 01:06:55,146
this is also where the traffic is,

1381
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:55,833
there's traffic here, too!

1382
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:57,978
And this is where the
British stole all of our stuff!

1383
01:07:00,185 --> 01:07:01,184
Ahh.

1384
01:07:01,455 --> 01:07:02,635
Hello, Spider man.

1385
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,333
- Hi.
- Hey.

1386
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:04,117
Not <i>you.</i>

1387
01:07:04,142 --> 01:07:05,811
- Are you talking to him, or me? Or... him?
- Well, what's that... that's me.

1388
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:06,636
I think he means me.

1389
01:07:06,661 --> 01:07:07,463
Yeah. Him.

1390
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:08,979
I got this, guys!

1391
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:09,822
Huh?

1392
01:07:09,847 --> 01:07:11,144
Wow! How are you?

1393
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:14,107
Since I leveled up my game,

1394
01:07:14,536 --> 01:07:16,723
I'm on a journey of self-improvement!

1395
01:07:16,748 --> 01:07:18,672
And you came to India.

1396
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:20,550
That's a Western culture cliche!

1397
01:07:21,935 --> 01:07:23,645
No, no, no! I did not mean it like that!

1398
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,158
Now, let me guess.

1399
01:07:24,183 --> 01:07:27,281
You wanna ask me about saffron
and cardamom and naan bread,

1400
01:07:27,306 --> 01:07:30,661
which is the same as saying "bread bread",
which is the same as saying "chai tea"!

1401
01:07:30,686 --> 01:07:31,648
Oh, I love chai tea!

1402
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:32,673
<i>No!</i>

1403
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:34,880
C'mon, man!

1404
01:07:35,364 --> 01:07:37,551
I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot.

1405
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:38,639
Let's talk about this!

1406
01:07:38,664 --> 01:07:39,258
Fine.

1407
01:07:39,283 --> 01:07:42,218
You made me feel empty,
like I had a hole inside of me!

1408
01:07:42,243 --> 01:07:43,551
We all have holes.

1409
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:46,763
But now, I found out
what to fill that hole up with!

1410
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:48,822
More holes!

1411
01:07:48,847 --> 01:07:50,668
That doesn't make any sense!

1412
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:51,693
-It will!

1413
01:07:52,116 --> 01:07:53,473
Okay. I'm good.

1414
01:07:53,498 --> 01:07:54,894
- Don't worry.
- We won't.

1415
01:07:55,093 --> 01:07:57,573
This romantic tension is so palpable!

1416
01:07:57,598 --> 01:07:58,703
-Will they, won't they...?

1417
01:07:58,728 --> 01:08:01,197
If Spot gets more holes,
he'll be unstoppable!

1418
01:08:01,222 --> 01:08:02,187
We can't let him get to-

1419
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,211
Alchemax?

1420
01:08:03,405 --> 01:08:05,192
How can you guys even concentrate?

1421
01:08:06,946 --> 01:08:08,720
Hey, does he know about Hobie?

1422
01:08:08,745 --> 01:08:10,286
What should I know about Hobie?

1423
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:12,159
Oh, looks like he did not know.

1424
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:15,740
Boop.

1425
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,332
Go away. Go away.

1426
01:08:19,357 --> 01:08:20,597
See you later. Take some holes.

1427
01:08:21,283 --> 01:08:24,516
Hey, you! Could you please
deactivate this wonderfully strong barrier?

1428
01:08:24,541 --> 01:08:26,999
It can't be turned off until
the collider sequence is complete!

1429
01:08:27,023 --> 01:08:28,333
Collider sequence?

1430
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:33,476
Wait! You don't know
what you're doing, man!

1431
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:34,398
Spot, you need to stop!

1432
01:08:34,422 --> 01:08:37,288
I'm about to be so much
more than a villain of the week.

1433
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:41,013
I'm sorry I called you that, okay?
You're a great villain.

1434
01:08:41,432 --> 01:08:42,478
Oh, not yet, I'm not.

1435
01:08:42,503 --> 01:08:43,972
Initializing collider.

1436
01:08:44,473 --> 01:08:45,473
No!

1437
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:52,522
How's it going now?

1438
01:08:52,547 --> 01:08:53,547
Great!

1439
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:54,610
Anyone got any ideas?

1440
01:08:54,642 --> 01:08:57,362
I have somebody in mind for this!

1441
01:08:57,859 --> 01:08:58,859
Stand back.

1442
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:00,725
I've been working on something new.

1443
01:09:12,013 --> 01:09:14,447
I'm not following what's
happening right now.

1444
01:09:14,472 --> 01:09:15,702
Just give me a second.

1445
01:09:15,727 --> 01:09:18,268
Do... do you want us to do something,
or do we just stand here?

1446
01:09:18,293 --> 01:09:19,882
Are you like, charging it...?

1447
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:21,958
No, I'm absorbing it so I can send it back!

1448
01:09:21,983 --> 01:09:23,604
- It looks like you're just...
- Does his power have a name?

1449
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:26,503
Please, hold your questions
until I'm done breaking this thing!

1450
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,807
Just let me do this!

1451
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:29,832
Oi!

1452
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,080
Hobie!

1453
01:09:43,297 --> 01:09:44,837
Hobie, my guy!

1454
01:09:44,862 --> 01:09:45,234
Hobie?

1455
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:46,262
Look at that. Another one.

1456
01:09:46,286 --> 01:09:48,959
I love how many different variations
of you guys there are. I mean...

1457
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:50,808
My left palm, big step up!

1458
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:51,370
You got me?

1459
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,297
What's this dude saying?

1460
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:55,869
It's English for "we get along great
and we're close friends"!

1461
01:09:55,894 --> 01:09:57,276
Is this the other one, from 1610?

1462
01:09:57,301 --> 01:09:58,400
- Do you understand this guy?
- Huh.

1463
01:09:58,424 --> 01:10:00,717
Hey, Hobie! Thanks for breaking the shield!

1464
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:01,788
I loosened it.

1465
01:10:01,813 --> 01:10:02,790
Bit of advice:

1466
01:10:02,815 --> 01:10:04,372
Use the palm, not just your fingers.

1467
01:10:05,724 --> 01:10:06,656
Also, your suit.

1468
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:07,870
Is he bleeding from his armpits?

1469
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:09,109
Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles.

1470
01:10:09,134 --> 01:10:12,083
Hi. I've never heard of you, because
Gwen barely ever mentioned you.

1471
01:10:12,259 --> 01:10:14,505
Hi, my name's Hobie. Hobie Brown.

1472
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:16,365
I was bitten by a...
wouldn't you like to know?

1473
01:10:16,389 --> 01:10:17,178
Yeah, I'm here.

1474
01:10:17,203 --> 01:10:19,422
And for the last three years, I've
been the one and only... wait, wait.

1475
01:10:19,446 --> 01:10:20,446
Hang on, wait, wait.

1476
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:22,310
Think I'm gonna show
you my secret identity?

1477
01:10:22,334 --> 01:10:23,214
Come out of it!

1478
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:26,197
That is, when I'm not playing
shows, antagonizing fascists,

1479
01:10:26,228 --> 01:10:29,506
staging unpermitted political
action-slash-performance art pieces,

1480
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:29,942
Or,

1481
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:31,595
having a laugh at a pub in...

1482
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,506
I'm not a role model.

1483
01:10:32,531 --> 01:10:34,026
I was briefly a runway model.

1484
01:10:34,051 --> 01:10:35,872
I hate the AM, I hate the PM,

1485
01:10:35,897 --> 01:10:36,778
I hate labels,

1486
01:10:36,803 --> 01:10:37,784
I'm not a hero,

1487
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,610
'cuz calling yourself a "hero"
makes you a self-mythologizing,

1488
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:42,241
narcissistic autocrat.

1489
01:10:42,266 --> 01:10:43,758
Oh, I thought you hated labels.

1490
01:10:44,051 --> 01:10:45,918
Gwendy, you left your
jumper around my place.

1491
01:10:45,943 --> 01:10:46,561
What's a jumper?

1492
01:10:46,586 --> 01:10:47,655
It's a sweater.

1493
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,094
How many sweaters do you have?

1494
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,963
Uh... that's... that's not my nature.

1495
01:10:50,988 --> 01:10:51,803
And your toothbrush.

1496
01:10:51,828 --> 01:10:52,828
Wait, what?

1497
01:10:53,454 --> 01:10:54,454
Are those my chucks?

1498
01:10:57,379 --> 01:10:58,767
Y'all make a heck of a team.

1499
01:10:58,792 --> 01:10:59,914
I don't believe in teams.

1500
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:01,145
Aren't you in a band?

1501
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,621
I don't believe in consistency.

1502
01:11:02,946 --> 01:11:04,372
This guy is killing me.

1503
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,727
Ahh!

1504
01:11:06,306 --> 01:11:07,946
This is gonna be good for us, Spider man.

1505
01:11:09,645 --> 01:11:12,231
You and me are finally
gonna live up to our potential.

1506
01:11:12,797 --> 01:11:15,089
You'll finally have a
villain worth fighting,

1507
01:11:15,114 --> 01:11:17,141
and I won't be just a <i>joke</i> to you!

1508
01:11:26,913 --> 01:11:28,653
You're not a joke! Right, gang?

1509
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,217
Absolutely!
- Completely unamusing!

1510
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:31,412
I don't believe in comedy!

1511
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:33,157
Just kidding!

1512
01:11:33,182 --> 01:11:34,069
See?

1513
01:11:34,094 --> 01:11:35,786
No one here thinks you're a joke!

1514
01:11:35,811 --> 01:11:36,811
They won't after this.

1515
01:11:37,352 --> 01:11:38,352
No!

1516
01:11:44,178 --> 01:11:46,005
Well, that was another easy adventure

1517
01:11:46,044 --> 01:11:47,284
- for Spider man!
- No, no, no!!

1518
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:06,421
I'm coming!

1519
01:12:10,109 --> 01:12:11,402
Huh...

1520
01:12:16,793 --> 01:12:17,973
What was that?

1521
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,005
Our future.

1522
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,973
I'm gonna take everything from you.

1523
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:28,754
Like you took everything from me.

1524
01:12:30,618 --> 01:12:31,618
What?

1525
01:12:32,026 --> 01:12:33,686
-See you back home...

1526
01:12:34,223 --> 01:12:35,563
Spider man.

1527
01:12:39,071 --> 01:12:40,877
Miles? Miles!

1528
01:12:49,607 --> 01:12:51,527
Everyone...

1529
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:06,267
We'll clear the path,

1530
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:07,858
you slow down that building!

1531
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:10,178
I'll do it, but not because you told me to.

1532
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:19,371
Everybody, run!

1533
01:14:17,395 --> 01:14:18,395
No!

1534
01:14:28,278 --> 01:14:29,178
Gwen, heads up.

1535
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:31,225
Markers are predicting
an incoming canon event,

1536
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:32,250
so tread carefully.

1537
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,734
I'm on it.

1538
01:14:35,765 --> 01:14:37,331
Somebody help!

1539
01:14:37,356 --> 01:14:39,116
- Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly!
- Help!

1540
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:46,697
Inspector Singh!

1541
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,440
I can do both...!

1542
01:14:56,521 --> 01:14:57,887
Where's your...

1543
01:14:58,209 --> 01:14:59,379
I got him, I got him!

1544
01:14:59,404 --> 01:15:00,404
Miles!

1545
01:15:00,473 --> 01:15:02,474
Don't worry. Thread the
needle, ring the bell, right?

1546
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,390
It's too dangerous.

1547
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:04,963
I'll be okay, I... I promise.

1548
01:15:04,988 --> 01:15:06,526
Miles! No!

1549
01:15:20,977 --> 01:15:22,696
Miles!

1550
01:15:22,721 --> 01:15:23,213
No!

1551
01:15:23,238 --> 01:15:24,820
No, no, no, no... oh...

1552
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:28,282
Please, no!

1553
01:15:28,307 --> 01:15:29,085
Miles?

1554
01:15:29,110 --> 01:15:30,330
Come on!

1555
01:15:36,015 --> 01:15:37,015
You're alright!

1556
01:15:37,603 --> 01:15:38,603
I promised.

1557
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:45,066
Oh!

1558
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:46,532
Are you okay? I was so worried!

1559
01:15:46,557 --> 01:15:47,825
I mean...

1560
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:50,884
You seem like a nice young
woman that I do not know!

1561
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:52,329
Papa!

1562
01:15:52,354 --> 01:15:53,354
Gayatri!

1563
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,800
Papa?

1564
01:15:58,135 --> 01:15:59,135
Not bad, right?

1565
01:16:03,453 --> 01:16:04,453
Right.

1566
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:08,544
I have never seen him so emotional!

1567
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:09,569
Excellent job.

1568
01:16:19,890 --> 01:16:21,930
Done, done!

1569
01:16:21,955 --> 01:16:24,049
Miles, my guy!

1570
01:16:35,931 --> 01:16:36,873
So?

1571
01:16:36,898 --> 01:16:37,898
Whaddya think?

1572
01:16:38,697 --> 01:16:39,797
What I always think.

1573
01:16:40,988 --> 01:16:41,988
You're amazing.

1574
01:16:43,595 --> 01:16:45,395
We... make a good team.

1575
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:47,424
Yeah?

1576
01:16:48,085 --> 01:16:49,085
Yeah.

1577
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:56,974
Guys, what's that?

1578
01:16:58,369 --> 01:16:59,783
It's a metaphor for capitalism.

1579
01:17:02,277 --> 01:17:03,430
It's a lot worse than that.

1580
01:17:10,223 --> 01:17:12,891
Okay, guys. Secure the
area, clear all civilians,

1581
01:17:12,915 --> 01:17:14,670
and let's contain this quantum hole.

1582
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:15,782
Hey, I'm Miles. Uh...

1583
01:17:15,807 --> 01:17:18,206
We actually met before.
When I was invisible.

1584
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:19,413
I know who you are.

1585
01:17:22,969 --> 01:17:24,727
Is everything going to be okay?

1586
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:34,141
Okay...

1587
01:17:34,166 --> 01:17:36,719
- let me... let me explain.
- Miguel wants you back at HQ.

1588
01:17:36,744 --> 01:17:37,981
Miles was just about to head out, for...

1589
01:17:38,005 --> 01:17:39,259
<i>All</i> of you.

1590
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,992
I don't follow orders. Neither does he.

1591
01:17:41,017 --> 01:17:42,197
I'm invited to HQ?

1592
01:17:42,757 --> 01:17:43,757
Whoo!

1593
01:17:57,901 --> 01:18:00,234
How are you even cooler under your mask?

1594
01:18:00,605 --> 01:18:02,058
I was just cool the whole time.

1595
01:18:10,244 --> 01:18:11,244
Dang.

1596
01:18:18,835 --> 01:18:19,652
Hey.

1597
01:18:19,677 --> 01:18:20,676
Over here.

1598
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:27,416
Yo!

1599
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:28,816
This place is wild!

1600
01:18:28,841 --> 01:18:29,736
Any sign of Spot?

1601
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:30,588
Let me ask.

1602
01:18:30,613 --> 01:18:32,615
Hey, anybody <i>spot</i> Spot?

1603
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,590
Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes?

1604
01:18:34,615 --> 01:18:35,714
Now that you mention it...

1605
01:18:40,075 --> 01:18:41,881
This is unbelievable!

1606
01:18:41,906 --> 01:18:43,138
This is the lobby.

1607
01:18:43,558 --> 01:18:44,558
Oh.

1608
01:18:44,673 --> 01:18:47,959
Welcome to Spider society!

1609
01:18:57,154 --> 01:18:58,434
Bit much, innit?

1610
01:18:59,066 --> 01:19:01,813
What happened to that
small elite strike team?

1611
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:02,998
A lot of these are part-time.

1612
01:19:04,834 --> 01:19:06,287
Gwendy, how much have you told him?

1613
01:19:06,691 --> 01:19:08,418
Hmm? About his place in all this.

1614
01:19:08,746 --> 01:19:09,746
A little.

1615
01:19:10,618 --> 01:19:11,291
Ahh.

1616
01:19:11,316 --> 01:19:12,316
Maybe not enough.

1617
01:19:12,751 --> 01:19:13,751
Here.

1618
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:15,742
Oh! My own watch!

1619
01:19:15,767 --> 01:19:17,177
- It's a day pass.
- Oh.

1620
01:19:17,202 --> 01:19:18,202
This just keeps you from-

1621
01:19:19,767 --> 01:19:20,767
...doing that.

1622
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:22,565
Hup, hup, hup!

1623
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,005
- Hey, Gwen!
- Hey, Peter.

1624
01:19:24,742 --> 01:19:26,542
- Hey, I'm Miles.
- Hey, Gwen. - Hi, Gwen.

1625
01:19:26,567 --> 01:19:27,611
Hey, Peters.

1626
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:28,721
I'm, uh... I'm a new recruit.

1627
01:19:28,745 --> 01:19:32,465
Peter, take a team to the transport
deck to help deal with this Spot mess.

1628
01:19:33,187 --> 01:19:34,847
I wouldn't call it a <i>mess.</i>

1629
01:19:34,872 --> 01:19:36,958
More like a... success in progress.

1630
01:19:36,983 --> 01:19:37,505
Ben, I need-

1631
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,692
Sorry. I can't talk right now.

1632
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:41,332
Thinking about my past.

1633
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:43,211
Actually, we need you
here, for some reason.

1634
01:19:44,549 --> 01:19:46,737
That was a particularly...<i>harrowing</i> memory.

1635
01:19:46,762 --> 01:19:47,422
Is... is he okay?

1636
01:19:47,447 --> 01:19:48,419
Ahh!

1637
01:19:48,444 --> 01:19:50,444
Hey. The name's Web-Slinger.

1638
01:19:50,469 --> 01:19:52,506
Why does the horse need a mask?

1639
01:19:52,531 --> 01:19:54,259
To conceal her face.

1640
01:19:54,473 --> 01:19:56,087
Giddy... up!

1641
01:19:57,258 --> 01:19:59,134
Who is in these laser cages?

1642
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,452
Anomalies. Folks who wound
up in the wrong dimension.

1643
01:20:01,477 --> 01:20:03,407
We kick their butts, and send 'em home!

1644
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:04,300
They're not very interesting.

1645
01:20:04,325 --> 01:20:04,740
What?

1646
01:20:04,765 --> 01:20:06,643
- We got a bunch'a Doc Ocs.
- Well, that's interesting!

1647
01:20:06,667 --> 01:20:08,054
- A Mysterio, - Ooh.

1648
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:09,012
A <i>Miss</i> terio.

1649
01:20:09,037 --> 01:20:10,107
- Wow!
- Video game guy,

1650
01:20:10,132 --> 01:20:11,354
-I love video games!

1651
01:20:11,379 --> 01:20:12,569
Another video game guy...

1652
01:20:12,594 --> 01:20:13,618
Are you talking to me?

1653
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:14,812
<i>Typeface.</i>

1654
01:20:14,837 --> 01:20:17,042
Go to <i>Helvetica,</i> Spider man!

1655
01:20:17,067 --> 01:20:17,474
Bold.

1656
01:20:17,499 --> 01:20:18,898
An interesting Kraven,

1657
01:20:18,923 --> 01:20:20,319
a boring rhino,

1658
01:20:20,344 --> 01:20:21,424
a Prowler,

1659
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:22,460
Prowler?

1660
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:23,485
Not your Prowler.

1661
01:20:24,524 --> 01:20:25,524
Hey.

1662
01:20:26,619 --> 01:20:27,619
Hey.

1663
01:20:30,624 --> 01:20:32,104
It's rude to stare.

1664
01:20:32,129 --> 01:20:33,655
- Caught that one myself.
- I slipped.

1665
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,403
You? Okay, I did all the work.

1666
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:35,796
You...

1667
01:20:35,808 --> 01:20:36,946
How many missions
have you been on together?

1668
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:38,370
- Oh, not that many.
- Couple dozen.

1669
01:20:38,906 --> 01:20:39,719
That's cool.

1670
01:20:39,744 --> 01:20:40,744
Sorry.

1671
01:20:43,067 --> 01:20:43,987
I'm Spider man.

1672
01:20:44,012 --> 01:20:45,308
Wow, no way!

1673
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:46,249
All of us are.

1674
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,699
Can we just keep moving?

1675
01:20:47,724 --> 01:20:48,617
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1676
01:20:48,642 --> 01:20:49,439
What are you?

1677
01:20:49,464 --> 01:20:50,579
I'm an avatar!

1678
01:20:51,187 --> 01:20:53,140
My body is back in
my parents' dimension,

1679
01:20:53,152 --> 01:20:55,305
chilling in my game
chair, and eating Fritos.

1680
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:57,406
Surprising! You don't listen!

1681
01:20:57,431 --> 01:20:59,036
Here is... better.

1682
01:20:59,061 --> 01:21:00,102
Hear that.

1683
01:21:02,646 --> 01:21:04,024
What does <i>that</i> do?

1684
01:21:04,049 --> 01:21:05,418
Apart from having a great name?

1685
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:06,285
Go Home Machine.

1686
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:07,412
What'd I say, eh?

1687
01:21:07,437 --> 01:21:08,437
I voted against it.

1688
01:21:08,637 --> 01:21:11,257
It detects whatever
dimension your DNA is from,

1689
01:21:11,282 --> 01:21:12,888
and sends you there.

1690
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,355
Super humane, and <i>not</i> creepy.

1691
01:21:16,527 --> 01:21:18,410
-See you, guy! Don't come back!

1692
01:21:20,929 --> 01:21:22,274
We should go. We don't wanna keep Miguel...

1693
01:21:22,298 --> 01:21:23,671
I'll... s-see you around?

1694
01:21:23,696 --> 01:21:24,408
Let's go!

1695
01:21:24,433 --> 01:21:25,928
- Hey, good luck out there, man.
- Whoa! Whoa.

1696
01:21:25,952 --> 01:21:26,900
Okay, bye!

1697
01:21:26,925 --> 01:21:28,158
Miguel sounds hangry.

1698
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:30,308
He likes those empanadas
from the cafeteria.

1699
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:35,131
My name is Miguel O'Hara.

1700
01:21:37,493 --> 01:21:40,093
I'm this dimension's
one and only Spider man.

1701
01:21:42,453 --> 01:21:43,566
Or, at least I was.

1702
01:21:47,258 --> 01:21:48,805
But I'm not like the others.

1703
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,823
I don't always like what I have to do.

1704
01:21:54,898 --> 01:21:56,805
But I know I have to be the one to do it.

1705
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:00,848
I've given up too much to stop now.

1706
01:22:03,622 --> 01:22:05,042
Hoo, yo!

1707
01:22:06,293 --> 01:22:07,829
Bet this doesn't even do anything.

1708
01:22:07,854 --> 01:22:10,260
Maybe it did, before
you ripped it out of a wall!

1709
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,873
Propaganda, bro.

1710
01:22:11,898 --> 01:22:13,370
It'll distract you from the truth.

1711
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,059
And what's that?

1712
01:22:15,325 --> 01:22:16,565
I ain't got a Scooby Doo, mate.

1713
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,016
'Cuz that's what they want.

1714
01:22:23,165 --> 01:22:24,805
Why do you wanna be a part of this stuff?

1715
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:26,587
To get a watch.

1716
01:22:26,612 --> 01:22:27,534
Make your own watch.

1717
01:22:27,559 --> 01:22:28,607
Pshh.

1718
01:22:28,632 --> 01:22:30,867
Bet you... bet you got a nice
setup, huh? Nice parents?

1719
01:22:30,892 --> 01:22:31,892
They're fine.

1720
01:22:32,264 --> 01:22:33,950
I mean, we got in a fight, but...

1721
01:22:35,196 --> 01:22:37,309
they just want what's best for me. So...

1722
01:22:37,607 --> 01:22:38,607
That's a bloody shame.

1723
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:40,359
Why?

1724
01:22:41,441 --> 01:22:43,228
'Cuz you're not ready for everybody else.

1725
01:22:52,189 --> 01:22:53,189
Get down.

1726
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:56,557
Listen to me, bruv.

1727
01:22:57,485 --> 01:22:59,486
-The whole point of being
Spider man is your independence.

1728
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:01,398
Being your own boss,
you don't need all this!

1729
01:23:01,423 --> 01:23:02,553
Then why are <i>you</i> here?

1730
01:23:03,457 --> 01:23:04,790
Looking out for my drummer, is all.

1731
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:06,163
I <i>want</i> to be in a band.

1732
01:23:06,188 --> 01:23:08,518
I... I wanna see my friends, and...

1733
01:23:08,543 --> 01:23:10,024
I need a watch to do that.

1734
01:23:10,049 --> 01:23:11,781
Guys, come on.

1735
01:23:11,806 --> 01:23:13,707
Alright. Squashed.

1736
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:17,104
Just don't enlist until you
know about who you're fighting.

1737
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:41,555
Yeah, I know. It's slow.

1738
01:23:42,306 --> 01:23:43,799
But... it's his thing.

1739
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,685
Miguel O'Hara?

1740
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:48,533
Meet Miles Morales.

1741
01:23:48,558 --> 01:23:50,333
Hey! <i>¿Qué tal, tío?</i>

1742
01:23:50,904 --> 01:23:52,207
I speak Spanish.

1743
01:23:53,318 --> 01:23:55,451
<i>Te traje una empanada-</i>

1744
01:23:56,634 --> 01:23:57,634
<i>Qué maravilla.</i>

1745
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:03,264
That's not... I'm really
excited to get going. I got some...

1746
01:24:03,276 --> 01:24:03,898
Oh? Great.

1747
01:24:03,922 --> 01:24:05,668
Fresh new ideas on how to catch the Spot.

1748
01:24:05,693 --> 01:24:08,529
- He just wants to be taken seriously.
- Oh, wow! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1749
01:24:08,553 --> 01:24:09,085
Whoa!

1750
01:24:09,341 --> 01:24:11,085
He's worried about Spot.

1751
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:12,468
I'll worry about Spot!

1752
01:24:12,493 --> 01:24:13,173
What did I do?

1753
01:24:13,197 --> 01:24:15,184
Miguel! It's not his fault!

1754
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:16,415
Fault? Hold up.

1755
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,871
You blew another hole in the multiverse!

1756
01:24:17,895 --> 01:24:19,214
He doesn't know any better!

1757
01:24:19,239 --> 01:24:21,034
I do know... what... uhh, not know...

1758
01:24:21,059 --> 01:24:22,686
But <i>you did,</i> Gwen.

1759
01:24:23,427 --> 01:24:24,427
And <i>you...</i>

1760
01:24:25,334 --> 01:24:26,722
I was gonna try and ignore you.

1761
01:24:26,747 --> 01:24:28,547
- I just can't, with you.
- I'm not even here.

1762
01:24:29,405 --> 01:24:30,405
Not really.

1763
01:24:30,615 --> 01:24:31,462
What's happening?

1764
01:24:31,487 --> 01:24:32,868
Hey, Miguel!

1765
01:24:33,126 --> 01:24:35,366
Come on, go easy on the kid.

1766
01:24:35,764 --> 01:24:38,050
He had a terrible teacher!

1767
01:24:39,323 --> 01:24:40,623
He had no chance!

1768
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:42,537
- Peter! Peter?
- Oh boy!

1769
01:24:42,562 --> 01:24:45,160
Humbling reality Spider man has arrived.

1770
01:24:45,185 --> 01:24:46,636
- Miles!
- Dude!

1771
01:24:46,661 --> 01:24:48,168
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel,

1772
01:24:48,192 --> 01:24:50,240
he just looks scary. He's got no bite.

1773
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:51,019
<i>Peter.</i>

1774
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,972
-You're growing up on me! You look great!

1775
01:24:52,997 --> 01:24:54,137
Ehh...

1776
01:24:54,162 --> 01:24:56,671
- You look solid. Y'know? You look good.
- Define <i>solid</i>.

1777
01:24:56,696 --> 01:24:58,653
What happened? You
bleeding from the armpits?

1778
01:24:58,678 --> 01:24:59,329
Peter, you...

1779
01:24:59,341 --> 01:25:01,329
Don't worry about the
suit. We'll get you a new suit.

1780
01:25:01,353 --> 01:25:03,012
Peter, you gotta tell him...

1781
01:25:03,037 --> 01:25:03,799
Wait...

1782
01:25:03,824 --> 01:25:05,010
What is that?

1783
01:25:05,035 --> 01:25:05,643
Mayday!

1784
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:08,025
- You have a baby! This is crazy!
- I have a baby.

1785
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:10,450
Don't forget to keep your
little day pass on, honey!

1786
01:25:10,475 --> 01:25:11,365
Oh, you have one, too.

1787
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:13,133
I didn't know they made those for adults.

1788
01:25:13,158 --> 01:25:14,754
Gimme a second. Mayday!

1789
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:16,371
Kid's an anarchist.

1790
01:25:16,396 --> 01:25:19,234
I'm coming up to get you! Here I come!

1791
01:25:21,342 --> 01:25:24,118
Ha! I knew I was gonna regret
making her that web shooter.

1792
01:25:24,143 --> 01:25:26,233
I shouldn't have done it.
That's an actual mistake.

1793
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:28,128
Wanna see pictures?

1794
01:25:28,153 --> 01:25:29,515
- I mean, she's right there, so...
- Look at this pic!

1795
01:25:29,539 --> 01:25:30,763
Oh! You've got...
okay, uh, wow.

1796
01:25:30,775 --> 01:25:32,895
Look at this special kid! Oh, she's incredible!
- Mm-hmm.

1797
01:25:32,919 --> 01:25:34,258
- Yup. - This is her funny face.
- Mm-hmm.

1798
01:25:34,282 --> 01:25:35,937
Oh, that's her mad face.

1799
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:37,741
This one is the studious one.

1800
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:40,304
Watch out, the next one, you're
gonna crack up! You're gonna crack up.

1801
01:25:40,328 --> 01:25:42,263
Oh, Miguel's gonna die.

1802
01:25:42,288 --> 01:25:43,578
Miguel! Miguel, look at this one.

1803
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:45,692
I'm trying to hold a serious
adult conversation, here.

1804
01:25:45,716 --> 01:25:47,530
You know, you're the only
Spider man who isn't funny.

1805
01:25:47,554 --> 01:25:48,865
We're supposed to be funny!

1806
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:50,175
The fate of the multiverse...

1807
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,855
You always lose me with that!

1808
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,343
You say, <i>"the fate of the multiverse",</i>

1809
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:56,188
...and my brain dies!

1810
01:25:56,213 --> 01:25:57,619
We are...

1811
01:25:57,644 --> 01:25:59,489
You guys smell that? Mayday took a crap.

1812
01:25:59,514 --> 01:26:00,683
Yup! She's a Parker.

1813
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:02,066
That's what happens when
a Parker eats an avocado.

1814
01:26:02,078 --> 01:26:02,534
Miles.

1815
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,108
You disrupted a canon event.

1816
01:26:04,133 --> 01:26:04,866
Canon event?

1817
01:26:04,891 --> 01:26:06,427
The kid wasn't thinking!

1818
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:07,914
That's not how he works!

1819
01:26:07,939 --> 01:26:08,993
That's insulting.

1820
01:26:09,018 --> 01:26:11,391
Taking a crap on the
establishment. I salute you.

1821
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,152
Wait, what are you upset about?

1822
01:26:13,177 --> 01:26:14,592
I saved those people.

1823
01:26:14,617 --> 01:26:15,729
And that's the problem.

1824
01:26:17,614 --> 01:26:19,427
Lyla? Do the thing.

1825
01:26:19,452 --> 01:26:20,772
Huh? What thing?

1826
01:26:20,797 --> 01:26:21,767
What... what do you mean, "what thing"?

1827
01:26:21,791 --> 01:26:23,687
The information explaining thing!

1828
01:26:23,712 --> 01:26:24,712
...Okay.

1829
01:26:31,082 --> 01:26:32,356
What's this?

1830
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,579
This... is everything.

1831
01:26:41,323 --> 01:26:43,197
Can you be more specific?

1832
01:26:43,222 --> 01:26:45,544
Can you not talk for a second?

1833
01:26:45,569 --> 01:26:46,569
Yeah, yeah.

1834
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:48,791
This, here...

1835
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:51,526
This is all of us.

1836
01:26:52,092 --> 01:26:55,238
All of our lives woven together,

1837
01:26:55,263 --> 01:26:58,510
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

1838
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:00,778
The Spider verse.

1839
01:27:00,803 --> 01:27:01,803
The Spider verse?

1840
01:27:02,321 --> 01:27:03,622
Huh, that's...

1841
01:27:03,646 --> 01:27:04,646
stupid.

1842
01:27:05,201 --> 01:27:07,635
It's called the Arachno-Humanoid
Poly-Multiverse.

1843
01:27:08,832 --> 01:27:09,832
Which sounds...

1844
01:27:10,448 --> 01:27:11,681
stupid too, I guess.

1845
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:15,842
And these nodes, where the minds converge?

1846
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,780
-They are the canon.

1847
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:22,642
-Chapters that are a part of
every Spider's story, every time.

1848
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:24,831
Some good...

1849
01:27:26,037 --> 01:27:27,037
some bad...

1850
01:27:29,559 --> 01:27:30,673
some <i>very</i> bad.

1851
01:27:38,756 --> 01:27:39,993
Just keep going.

1852
01:27:40,392 --> 01:27:41,539
Uncle Aaron...

1853
01:27:42,426 --> 01:27:45,373
This one, event ASM-90,

1854
01:27:46,124 --> 01:27:48,871
a police captain close to Spider man dies

1855
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:52,693
saving a kid from falling rubble
during a battle with an arch-nemesis.

1856
01:27:53,619 --> 01:27:54,693
Captain Stacy...

1857
01:27:56,024 --> 01:27:57,051
I'm so sorry.

1858
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,356
That happened to you?

1859
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:25,347
And me.

1860
01:28:29,269 --> 01:28:30,723
Eh? What of it?

1861
01:28:31,517 --> 01:28:33,810
That's how the story's supposed to go.

1862
01:28:35,025 --> 01:28:37,252
The canon events are the connections

1863
01:28:37,277 --> 01:28:39,516
that bind our lives together.

1864
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:42,620
And those connections can be broken.

1865
01:28:44,031 --> 01:28:46,499
That's why <i>anomalies...</i>

1866
01:28:47,319 --> 01:28:48,472
are so dangerous.

1867
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:52,207
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

1868
01:28:52,232 --> 01:28:54,366
<i>You</i> weren't supposed to be there,

1869
01:28:54,391 --> 01:28:56,807
and <i>you</i> weren't supposed to save him.

1870
01:28:57,402 --> 01:28:58,993
That's why Gwen tried to stop you.

1871
01:28:59,391 --> 01:29:00,391
-Miles!

1872
01:29:00,457 --> 01:29:02,251
I thought you were trying to save me.

1873
01:29:04,148 --> 01:29:05,762
I was. I...

1874
01:29:07,163 --> 01:29:08,477
I was doing both.

1875
01:29:09,264 --> 01:29:11,117
And now, Miles,

1876
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:13,883
because you changed the story,

1877
01:29:13,908 --> 01:29:16,318
Pavitr's dimension is unraveling.

1878
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:19,785
If we're lucky... we can stop it.

1879
01:29:21,571 --> 01:29:23,098
We haven't always been lucky.

1880
01:29:23,123 --> 01:29:24,525
That... that wasn't <i>me.</i>

1881
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:25,572
That was the Spot!

1882
01:29:25,597 --> 01:29:27,987
It's what happens when you break the canon.

1883
01:29:30,575 --> 01:29:31,575
How do you know?

1884
01:29:32,527 --> 01:29:34,621
Because I broke it once myself.

1885
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,580
I found another world where I had a family.

1886
01:29:39,315 --> 01:29:40,568
Where I was happy.

1887
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,550
At least, a version of me was.

1888
01:29:44,981 --> 01:29:47,821
And that version of myself was killed.

1889
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:54,905
So I replaced him.

1890
01:29:57,703 --> 01:29:59,543
I thought it was harmless.

1891
01:30:03,138 --> 01:30:04,265
But I was wrong.

1892
01:30:14,638 --> 01:30:16,410
Dad! Dad, help!

1893
01:30:21,537 --> 01:30:22,737
Isn't that right, Peter?

1894
01:30:23,999 --> 01:30:24,999
Yeah.

1895
01:30:25,939 --> 01:30:29,066
You break enough canon,
you save enough captains,

1896
01:30:30,773 --> 01:30:32,973
and we could lose everything.

1897
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,136
My dad is about to be captain.

1898
01:30:56,559 --> 01:30:57,559
No...

1899
01:30:59,919 --> 01:31:02,013
I'm going to take everything from you,

1900
01:31:03,874 --> 01:31:05,457
- Help!
- ...like you took everything from me.

1901
01:31:05,481 --> 01:31:06,481
I'm coming!

1902
01:31:11,005 --> 01:31:12,441
Spot does it.

1903
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,530
<i>He</i> kills him.

1904
01:31:21,956 --> 01:31:24,216
When does it happen?

1905
01:31:27,646 --> 01:31:28,568
When does it happen?

1906
01:31:28,593 --> 01:31:29,801
In two days.

1907
01:31:30,942 --> 01:31:32,248
When he's sworn in.

1908
01:31:33,412 --> 01:31:35,272
That's... what the model says.

1909
01:31:37,415 --> 01:31:38,740
-I'm sorry, Miles.

1910
01:31:38,765 --> 01:31:39,771
Send me home!

1911
01:31:40,545 --> 01:31:41,545
I can't do that.

1912
01:31:41,867 --> 01:31:42,899
-Not now.

1913
01:31:43,306 --> 01:31:45,599
What am I supposed
to do? Just let him die?!

1914
01:31:50,069 --> 01:31:51,309
What about <i>your</i> dad?

1915
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:53,180
He's a captain. Right?

1916
01:31:55,579 --> 01:31:56,579
Yeah.

1917
01:31:57,069 --> 01:31:58,270
And that's it?

1918
01:31:58,294 --> 01:32:00,014
You just aren't gonna do anything about it?

1919
01:32:03,024 --> 01:32:04,843
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

1920
01:32:04,868 --> 01:32:06,548
That'd've been okay, if you knew,

1921
01:32:06,573 --> 01:32:08,925
and you just... let it play out?!

1922
01:32:09,576 --> 01:32:12,008
If not for Uncle Ben,

1923
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:14,753
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

1924
01:32:15,895 --> 01:32:17,829
And all the good we did, it...

1925
01:32:18,348 --> 01:32:20,001
it wouldn't have been done.

1926
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:25,623
So we're just supposed to let people die,

1927
01:32:25,648 --> 01:32:27,472
-because some <i>algorithm,</i>
-Oh! Whoa!

1928
01:32:27,497 --> 01:32:29,267
Says that that's supposed to happen?

1929
01:32:29,292 --> 01:32:31,937
You realize how messed
up that sounds, right?

1930
01:32:31,962 --> 01:32:35,096
You have a choice between saving one person

1931
01:32:35,121 --> 01:32:37,088
and saving an <i>entire world.</i>

1932
01:32:37,113 --> 01:32:37,990
Every world!

1933
01:32:38,015 --> 01:32:39,190
I can do <i>both!</i>

1934
01:32:39,215 --> 01:32:41,729
- Spider man always...
- Not always.

1935
01:32:45,475 --> 01:32:46,161
Miles.

1936
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,522
We all want to live
the life we wish we had.

1937
01:32:49,239 --> 01:32:51,730
Believe me, I have tried.

1938
01:32:51,755 --> 01:32:53,798
And the harder I tried,

1939
01:32:53,823 --> 01:32:55,556
the more damage I did.

1940
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:58,517
You can't have it all, kid.

1941
01:33:03,187 --> 01:33:05,464
Being Spider man is a sacrifice.

1942
01:33:06,125 --> 01:33:07,125
That's the job.

1943
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:09,355
That's what you signed up for.

1944
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,331
Miles...

1945
01:33:13,912 --> 01:33:14,912
Peni?

1946
01:33:16,509 --> 01:33:17,509
What is this?

1947
01:33:19,012 --> 01:33:20,866
Is this an intervention or something?

1948
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:22,680
We know it's hard.

1949
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:25,339
But it's the truth, Miles.

1950
01:33:26,235 --> 01:33:27,382
Is <i>that</i> why you're here?

1951
01:33:28,385 --> 01:33:29,718
To let me down easy?

1952
01:33:32,332 --> 01:33:34,306
-Worked last time, why
not run it back, huh?

1953
01:33:34,331 --> 01:33:36,438
- Hey, hold on, hold on!
- You were right, Gwen.

1954
01:33:37,093 --> 01:33:39,132
-You should've never come to see me.

1955
01:33:39,157 --> 01:33:41,184
- Kid, look at me.
- Stop calling me that.

1956
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:41,711
Here we go.

1957
01:33:41,736 --> 01:33:42,791
Hobie, you're not helping.

1958
01:33:42,816 --> 01:33:43,816
Good.

1959
01:33:44,069 --> 01:33:45,269
Miles, please understand...

1960
01:33:45,294 --> 01:33:47,380
You can't ask me not to save my father.

1961
01:33:47,857 --> 01:33:48,857
I'm not asking.

1962
01:33:49,389 --> 01:33:51,117
I got this, just... give
him a second, <i>please.</i>

1963
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:52,468
- That's a great look.
- Don't!

1964
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:54,478
Stop it!

1965
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:56,658
You let him leave, he'll
only do more damage.

1966
01:33:56,683 --> 01:33:57,861
You both know that.

1967
01:33:58,835 --> 01:34:00,321
Just need to hold you a few days.

1968
01:34:00,712 --> 01:34:02,492
Sorry it had to end like this, kid.

1969
01:34:03,077 --> 01:34:04,331
I said...

1970
01:34:04,356 --> 01:34:05,876
not to call me that!

1971
01:34:18,114 --> 01:34:19,114
<i>Miles!</i>

1972
01:34:19,993 --> 01:34:22,371
Alright. I'm sorry for doing this.

1973
01:34:22,396 --> 01:34:23,971
This is bad parenting!

1974
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,207
This is where I reckon I quit.

1975
01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:33,466
All stations, drop what you're doing

1976
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:34,735
and stop Spider man!

1977
01:34:35,844 --> 01:34:36,844
You?

1978
01:34:39,344 --> 01:34:41,256
<i>Por Dios!</i> Miles! Miles Morales!

1979
01:34:41,281 --> 01:34:42,684
He's entering Sector 4!

1980
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:47,760
Is that him? Right?

1981
01:34:47,785 --> 01:34:50,479
Do I, uhh... have web on
my face? What's the deal?

1982
01:34:50,504 --> 01:34:52,312
Miles! Lord... he's
right there! He's right...

1983
01:34:52,336 --> 01:34:53,725
<i>Turn around!</i>

1984
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:54,830
I don't see anything, boss.

1985
01:35:08,388 --> 01:35:09,388
Whoa!

1986
01:35:13,595 --> 01:35:15,648
Could this day get any damn weirder?!

1987
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:18,711
Whoa!

1988
01:35:18,736 --> 01:35:19,764
I guess it can!

1989
01:35:26,704 --> 01:35:27,177
-Whoa!

1990
01:35:27,202 --> 01:35:28,202
Sorry!

1991
01:35:33,007 --> 01:35:35,053
And then I looked at my uncle, and...

1992
01:35:35,078 --> 01:35:36,453
Uhh, let me guess.

1993
01:35:36,478 --> 01:35:37,478
He died?

1994
01:35:47,045 --> 01:35:48,045
Whoa!

1995
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:51,700
On the count of three, draw.

1996
01:35:51,725 --> 01:35:52,178
-One...

1997
01:35:52,411 --> 01:35:53,622
You didn't wait for three!

1998
01:35:53,647 --> 01:35:55,114
Hey, Miguel!

1999
01:35:55,139 --> 01:35:57,259
Would you take a photo
of this? It's our first chase.

2000
01:35:58,416 --> 01:36:00,736
Yippi-ki-yay! Whoo!

2001
01:36:00,761 --> 01:36:02,874
Booooo!

2002
01:36:05,716 --> 01:36:06,369
Miles.

2003
01:36:06,394 --> 01:36:07,394
-Hi.

2004
01:36:07,713 --> 01:36:09,966
I'm a <i>huge</i> fan of your work.

2005
01:36:09,991 --> 01:36:10,301
-Thanks!

2006
01:36:10,326 --> 01:36:13,094
Do you think Spider people too
often use comedy as a crutch?

2007
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:13,714
Uhhh...

2008
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:14,871
Get it? Crutch?

2009
01:36:14,896 --> 01:36:15,896
<i>Oof!</i>

2010
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:17,644
I can do anything you can!

2011
01:36:17,669 --> 01:36:19,180
Ohhh, dang! I pulled something!

2012
01:36:28,053 --> 01:36:28,853
Hello, Peter.

2013
01:36:28,878 --> 01:36:29,878
Whoa!

2014
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,134
'Sup? There's nowhere to run.

2015
01:36:55,239 --> 01:36:57,639
My bad, everybody. There
was somewhere to run.

2016
01:37:06,323 --> 01:37:07,603
Stop running!

2017
01:37:07,628 --> 01:37:09,429
Then stop chasing me!

2018
01:37:09,927 --> 01:37:11,333
You're so frustrating!

2019
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:13,613
I know he's your friend,

2020
01:37:13,638 --> 01:37:15,265
but it's the only way!

2021
01:37:15,290 --> 01:37:16,525
But my gut says-

2022
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:17,920
Then use your head!

2023
01:37:27,779 --> 01:37:28,779
<i>Oof!</i>

2024
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:38,530
This is called the sleeper hold!

2025
01:37:38,555 --> 01:37:40,764
I'm using my bicep to constrict your-

2026
01:37:55,429 --> 01:37:56,429
Ah!

2027
01:38:01,243 --> 01:38:02,263
Miles!

2028
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,276
- No, no, no. Let me go!
- It is crazy to run!

2029
01:38:05,301 --> 01:38:08,045
Running is the least crazy thing going on!

2030
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,525
I feel bad!

2031
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:10,290
<i>Good!</i>

2032
01:38:10,315 --> 01:38:12,153
But this is just how stuff works!

2033
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:13,720
You're not gonna win, here!

2034
01:38:13,745 --> 01:38:16,560
- No. No.
- Wait, don't move! Stop moving so fast!

2035
01:38:16,585 --> 01:38:17,255
No!

2036
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,646
Do you wanna hold my baby?

2037
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:19,606
<i>What?</i>

2038
01:38:19,631 --> 01:38:21,877
Would you just give the baby
one squeeze, and then we'll talk?

2039
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,532
- Cuz I think it's gonna change our vibe.
- No!

2040
01:38:23,556 --> 01:38:24,856
It's <i>very</i> rejuvenating!

2041
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:25,956
I'm plenty <i>juvenated!</i>

2042
01:38:25,981 --> 01:38:27,236
You'll get more so

2043
01:38:27,261 --> 01:38:30,080
when you go chest to
chest with this magical child!

2044
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:31,754
You don't get to have a heartfelt

2045
01:38:31,778 --> 01:38:33,092
conversation
with me right now!

2046
01:38:33,104 --> 01:38:34,898
Just hold the baby,
we'll see what happens!

2047
01:38:36,254 --> 01:38:38,580
You're the reason I had her, okay?!

2048
01:38:39,979 --> 01:38:41,319
I thought...

2049
01:38:41,344 --> 01:38:43,517
that if I did a decent job raising her,

2050
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:47,370
there was a chance she
was gonna turn out like you.

2051
01:38:47,395 --> 01:38:50,721
And that got me excited, because
you are a <i>wonderful person!</i>

2052
01:38:51,289 --> 01:38:53,209
And I like being around you!

2053
01:38:54,803 --> 01:38:56,603
Then why didn't you come see me?

2054
01:38:57,618 --> 01:38:58,618
Be-...

2055
01:38:59,732 --> 01:39:00,732
I couldn't.

2056
01:39:01,819 --> 01:39:04,093
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.

2057
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:08,945
But this thing isn't what I thought it was.

2058
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:10,286
Look...

2059
01:39:10,311 --> 01:39:12,905
bad things are gonna happen.

2060
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,110
It makes us who we are.

2061
01:39:16,016 --> 01:39:18,843
But good things happen too, you know?

2062
01:39:19,685 --> 01:39:21,478
Like <i>you</i> happened.

2063
01:39:23,249 --> 01:39:24,555
And <i>she</i> happened.

2064
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:27,799
Hey! I don't... listen...

2065
01:39:27,824 --> 01:39:31,560
You are <i>so bad</i> at holding a baby!

2066
01:39:31,585 --> 01:39:32,722
We got your location, Peter.

2067
01:39:32,747 --> 01:39:34,133
- Inside the core.
- Wait! Wait, wait, wait, no! No, no!

2068
01:39:34,157 --> 01:39:36,304
You do <i>not</i> have my location! Over!

2069
01:39:36,329 --> 01:39:37,396
Send everyone.

2070
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:40,110
-No, no, no! Look... Miles!

2071
01:39:40,135 --> 01:39:42,294
I didn't know! I promise you!

2072
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:44,166
<i>Please,</i> man, let's talk about this.

2073
01:39:44,191 --> 01:39:45,191
We did.

2074
01:39:47,641 --> 01:39:48,844
Good talk.

2075
01:39:53,123 --> 01:39:54,123
Get him!

2076
01:40:02,945 --> 01:40:03,945
Ahh!

2077
01:40:06,893 --> 01:40:07,893
Miles!

2078
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,941
- Where does he think he's going?
- I don't think he planned this out.

2079
01:40:11,135 --> 01:40:13,088
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,

2080
01:40:13,113 --> 01:40:15,138
you're a <i>terrible</i> mentor.

2081
01:40:23,831 --> 01:40:25,564
He did just beat you!

2082
01:40:25,589 --> 01:40:27,401
So I'm not a <i>terrible</i> mentor!

2083
01:40:27,426 --> 01:40:29,897
You're both equally
terrible. Does that settle it?

2084
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,919
Stop pretending you know what you're doing!

2085
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:35,100
Oh, I have a plan.

2086
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:36,966
I just... haven't told you yet!

2087
01:40:41,241 --> 01:40:42,241
Whoa!

2088
01:40:52,718 --> 01:40:54,218
Departing for the Web.

2089
01:40:54,243 --> 01:40:55,304
That's not good.

2090
01:41:13,954 --> 01:41:15,140
What are those, claws?

2091
01:41:15,165 --> 01:41:17,233
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider man?

2092
01:41:18,169 --> 01:41:21,506
Are <i>you?</i> Who do you think you are? Really?

2093
01:41:24,689 --> 01:41:25,895
My name...

2094
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:27,550
is Miles Morales.

2095
01:41:33,257 --> 01:41:35,750
I was bitten by a radioactive spider!

2096
01:41:37,669 --> 01:41:40,309
And I'm pretty sure you know the rest, sir!

2097
01:41:49,783 --> 01:41:50,783
'Sup, man?

2098
01:41:52,931 --> 01:41:53,977
I don't get it!

2099
01:41:54,002 --> 01:41:54,969
You're an anomaly!

2100
01:41:54,994 --> 01:41:57,329
Not if you let me go home!

2101
01:42:00,738 --> 01:42:01,738
<i>Snitch!</i>

2102
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:06,060
Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly!

2103
01:42:13,938 --> 01:42:16,705
You're the original anomaly!

2104
01:42:20,359 --> 01:42:21,359
Miguel!

2105
01:42:22,068 --> 01:42:24,448
The spider that gave you your powers

2106
01:42:24,473 --> 01:42:26,122
wasn't from your dimension!

2107
01:42:27,794 --> 01:42:29,528
It was never supposed to bite you!

2108
01:42:30,536 --> 01:42:31,416
Miguel, don't!

2109
01:42:31,441 --> 01:42:34,495
There's a world out there with
no Spider man to protect them,

2110
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,051
because it bit you instead!

2111
01:42:36,076 --> 01:42:38,293
You're not supposed to be Spider man!

2112
01:42:38,318 --> 01:42:39,013
No!

2113
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:40,586
You're lying! I'm Spider man!

2114
01:42:40,611 --> 01:42:41,639
You're a <i>mistake!</i>

2115
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,626
If you hadn't been bit,

2116
01:42:45,651 --> 01:42:47,760
your Peter Parker would've lived!

2117
01:42:47,785 --> 01:42:50,259
Instead, he died, saving <i>you.</i>

2118
01:42:50,969 --> 01:42:53,816
-If you would've stopped the
collider before it ever went off,

2119
01:42:53,841 --> 01:42:55,331
Spot wouldn't exist,

2120
01:42:55,356 --> 01:42:57,784
and none of this would've happened.

2121
01:42:57,809 --> 01:42:58,569
<i>Aahh!</i>

2122
01:42:58,594 --> 01:43:00,103
And all this time,

2123
01:43:00,128 --> 01:43:02,421
<i>I</i> have been the only
one holding it all together!

2124
01:43:02,433 --> 01:43:03,201
Get off of me!

2125
01:43:03,226 --> 01:43:04,672
Miguel, go easy on him!

2126
01:43:04,697 --> 01:43:06,780
You don't belong here.

2127
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:08,128
You never did.

2128
01:43:08,153 --> 01:43:09,924
Let me go!

2129
01:43:09,949 --> 01:43:10,718
Miguel, that's enough!

2130
01:43:10,743 --> 01:43:12,252
This isn't what we talked about!

2131
01:43:13,658 --> 01:43:15,218
You talked about this?

2132
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:17,653
You <i>knew?</i>

2133
01:43:19,216 --> 01:43:21,082
-You... you all knew?

2134
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,825
I... I didn't know...

2135
01:43:25,012 --> 01:43:26,012
how to tell you.

2136
01:43:28,008 --> 01:43:30,069
That's why you never came to see me.

2137
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:35,646
Miles, it's for your own good!

2138
01:43:35,671 --> 01:43:36,776
Who decides that?!

2139
01:43:37,415 --> 01:43:39,002
I'm not a kid, Gwen!

2140
01:43:39,027 --> 01:43:39,718
<i>Ah!</i>

2141
01:43:39,743 --> 01:43:41,430
That's <i>exactly</i> what you are!

2142
01:43:41,455 --> 01:43:42,726
You're just a kid!

2143
01:43:42,751 --> 01:43:45,009
Who has <i>no idea</i>

2144
01:43:45,034 --> 01:43:46,468
what he's doing!

2145
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:53,154
Yeah, well...

2146
01:43:53,179 --> 01:43:56,555
I <i>did</i> lure hundreds of Spider
people away from your little clubhouse.

2147
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:57,580
Huh?

2148
01:44:03,050 --> 01:44:04,703
I guess he <i>did</i> plan this out!

2149
01:44:06,376 --> 01:44:07,425
And...

2150
01:44:07,450 --> 01:44:08,957
I'm about to do this.

2151
01:44:14,028 --> 01:44:18,222
Everyone keeps telling me
how <i>my story</i> is supposed to go.

2152
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:20,134
Nah.

2153
01:44:20,345 --> 01:44:21,769
Imma do my own thing.

2154
01:44:22,509 --> 01:44:23,664
Sorry, man.

2155
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:24,689
I'm going home.

2156
01:44:41,402 --> 01:44:42,402
Goodbye, Gwen.

2157
01:44:46,213 --> 01:44:47,213
Miles!

2158
01:44:51,492 --> 01:44:53,592
I taught him how to do that, so...

2159
01:44:53,617 --> 01:44:56,097
I gotta be a pretty good
mentor, to pull that off!

2160
01:45:06,989 --> 01:45:07,989
Nope.

2161
01:45:08,146 --> 01:45:09,146
No.

2162
01:45:09,317 --> 01:45:10,031
Uh-uh.

2163
01:45:10,264 --> 01:45:11,444
That's kinda cute.

2164
01:45:11,469 --> 01:45:12,469
<i>Oh,</i> no. No...

2165
01:45:13,976 --> 01:45:14,976
Ah!

2166
01:45:15,753 --> 01:45:16,753
Huh?

2167
01:45:23,479 --> 01:45:24,479
Hmm...

2168
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:36,796
Wha...?

2169
01:45:37,544 --> 01:45:39,497
Initializing Go Home Machine.

2170
01:45:52,709 --> 01:45:54,662
Retinal signature identified.

2171
01:46:05,062 --> 01:46:05,931
Come on...!

2172
01:46:05,956 --> 01:46:07,354
No!

2173
01:46:07,379 --> 01:46:09,552
No... no...<i>no!</i>

2174
01:46:15,563 --> 01:46:17,003
What's happening?

2175
01:46:17,028 --> 01:46:18,788
The machine activated on its own!

2176
01:46:18,813 --> 01:46:19,658
How's that possible?

2177
01:46:19,683 --> 01:46:20,683
It isn't!

2178
01:46:28,282 --> 01:46:28,895
How 'bout this?

2179
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,248
- No, no, no, no! <i>Ugh!</i>
- Hey, how 'bout now?

2180
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,381
You're getting in the way!

2181
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,086
Stop him!

2182
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:50,759
<i>Now!</i>

2183
01:46:50,999 --> 01:46:52,839
Man, what does it look
like I'm trying to do?!

2184
01:47:01,858 --> 01:47:03,105
Do something!

2185
01:47:03,457 --> 01:47:04,457
-<i>Now!</i>

2186
01:47:07,114 --> 01:47:08,114
Miguel!

2187
01:47:08,161 --> 01:47:09,160
Stop!

2188
01:47:36,917 --> 01:47:37,917
<i>No!</i>

2189
01:47:51,605 --> 01:47:54,498
O... okay, enough! It's
not the console's fault.

2190
01:47:54,523 --> 01:47:56,418
All he had to do was <i>listen!</i>

2191
01:47:57,451 --> 01:47:58,438
Why didn't he <i>listen?</i>

2192
01:47:58,463 --> 01:47:59,915
Maybe, you weren't hard enough on him!

2193
01:47:59,939 --> 01:48:00,906
Gwen, don't do it.

2194
01:48:00,931 --> 01:48:01,931
You let him go.

2195
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:03,346
- Me?
- You didn't catch him,

2196
01:48:03,371 --> 01:48:04,046
<i>Gwen.</i>

2197
01:48:04,058 --> 01:48:06,119
Okay, let's all just take a breath...
- Peter!

2198
01:48:06,144 --> 01:48:06,977
You wanna back me up?!

2199
01:48:07,002 --> 01:48:08,321
Well, okay. Miguel?

2200
01:48:08,346 --> 01:48:10,240
As a father of a daughter, and

2201
01:48:10,265 --> 01:48:11,472
the son of a mother...

2202
01:48:11,497 --> 01:48:12,672
Yeah, actually, stop talking.

2203
01:48:12,697 --> 01:48:13,805
Okay, duly noted.

2204
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:15,161
Let me just <i>talk</i> to him.

2205
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:17,723
We tried that.

2206
01:48:17,748 --> 01:48:18,816
He's my <i>friend.</i>

2207
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:19,925
Yeah, and that's the problem.

2208
01:48:19,949 --> 01:48:22,746
Do you know for certain what
happens if he breaks the canon?

2209
01:48:24,303 --> 01:48:25,617
You wanna find out?

2210
01:48:26,204 --> 01:48:27,984
I told you she was a liability!

2211
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:30,330
You're wrong.

2212
01:48:31,037 --> 01:48:31,964
Jess?

2213
01:48:31,989 --> 01:48:33,290
Tell him he's wrong.

2214
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:35,928
He's... not.

2215
01:48:35,953 --> 01:48:37,747
Are you serious right now?

2216
01:48:37,772 --> 01:48:38,986
I told you.

2217
01:48:39,011 --> 01:48:40,645
You let him get away,

2218
01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:41,785
I can't help you.

2219
01:48:42,327 --> 01:48:43,943
I'm not coming.

2220
01:48:43,968 --> 01:48:44,968
You're right.

2221
01:48:45,416 --> 01:48:46,416
What?

2222
01:48:47,676 --> 01:48:48,676
What the hell?!

2223
01:48:58,841 --> 01:49:00,161
Go home, Gwen.

2224
01:49:05,786 --> 01:49:08,052
We are supposed to be the good guys.

2225
01:49:24,373 --> 01:49:25,373
We are.

2226
01:49:28,714 --> 01:49:29,714
We are.

2227
01:49:31,537 --> 01:49:32,914
Jess. Ben.

2228
01:49:32,939 --> 01:49:33,848
Come with me.

2229
01:49:33,873 --> 01:49:34,903
Hell yeah!

2230
01:49:34,928 --> 01:49:36,722
Somebody catch Spot.

2231
01:49:36,747 --> 01:49:37,994
Yeah, sorry. I, uhh...

2232
01:49:38,019 --> 01:49:39,617
I gotta get her down for a nap.

2233
01:49:39,642 --> 01:49:40,616
Not <i>you.</i>

2234
01:49:40,641 --> 01:49:42,407
I've had the right amount of you.

2235
01:50:35,109 --> 01:50:37,122
How was work?

2236
01:50:37,147 --> 01:50:38,461
I don't know.

2237
01:50:38,486 --> 01:50:39,486
Peter?

2238
01:50:39,804 --> 01:50:42,004
Did you bring our baby to another fight?

2239
01:50:42,029 --> 01:50:44,424
Did I bring our ba-? No. No... no.

2240
01:50:44,449 --> 01:50:47,121
'Cuz you asked me not
to. So, I didn't. I wouldn't.

2241
01:50:47,146 --> 01:50:48,146
Mm-hmm.

2242
01:51:19,127 --> 01:51:20,627
You think I'll be any good at this?

2243
01:51:22,376 --> 01:51:23,682
You're asking that <i>now?</i>

2244
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:28,420
There's no playbook for
raising someone like her.

2245
01:51:29,228 --> 01:51:30,228
-Or...

2246
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:32,360
being someone like you.

2247
01:51:36,427 --> 01:51:38,989
You just gotta... make the
right adjustments at halftime.

2248
01:51:44,213 --> 01:51:46,599
- That's a sports metaphor, by the way.
- I understand.

2249
01:51:46,624 --> 01:51:47,542
Wow, sorry.

2250
01:51:47,567 --> 01:51:49,553
You were just such a nerd
in high school, I figured...

2251
01:51:49,577 --> 01:51:51,649
I <i>have</i> watched sports!

2252
01:51:51,674 --> 01:51:54,333
- Ah! Okay, champ.
- Unbelievable.

2253
01:52:22,476 --> 01:52:23,756
Wanna go easy on the penguin?

2254
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:25,777
Just...

2255
01:52:27,043 --> 01:52:28,343
You won't even look at me?

2256
01:52:30,678 --> 01:52:31,678
What?

2257
01:52:31,788 --> 01:52:33,008
What... what is that?

2258
01:52:33,964 --> 01:52:34,964
I'm looking at you.

2259
01:52:35,357 --> 01:52:36,357
Like you asked.

2260
01:52:39,109 --> 01:52:40,109
You look skinny.

2261
01:52:41,606 --> 01:52:42,606
Where have you been?

2262
01:52:42,949 --> 01:52:44,156
Just been, uhh...

2263
01:52:44,181 --> 01:52:46,076
out murdering all my friends.

2264
01:52:46,101 --> 01:52:48,956
Oh. Oh, that's funny, uhh, okay. Yeah.

2265
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:49,981
Okay.

2266
01:52:55,609 --> 01:52:56,349
Where are you going?

2267
01:52:56,374 --> 01:52:57,374
I don't know.

2268
01:53:01,967 --> 01:53:03,740
You're a good cop, Dad.

2269
01:53:04,829 --> 01:53:07,425
You know you put on that badge
because you know if you don't,

2270
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:09,390
someone who shouldn't will.

2271
01:53:10,586 --> 01:53:11,586
But...

2272
01:53:11,725 --> 01:53:13,665
you have to understand.

2273
01:53:13,690 --> 01:53:16,111
This mask is <i>my</i> badge.

2274
01:53:17,181 --> 01:53:20,018
And I'm <i>trying</i> to be good, too.

2275
01:53:20,599 --> 01:53:23,005
I was trying <i>so hard</i>

2276
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:25,271
to wear this thing the way you would want!

2277
01:53:26,087 --> 01:53:27,460
And I didn't.

2278
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:29,110
I didn't!

2279
01:53:29,276 --> 01:53:30,482
I can do all these things,

2280
01:53:30,507 --> 01:53:33,094
but I can't help the
people I love the most.

2281
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:35,722
And they can only know <i>half</i> of who I am!

2282
01:53:35,747 --> 01:53:39,206
So I'm...<i>completely</i> on my own!

2283
01:53:39,231 --> 01:53:40,622
And now, I don't...

2284
01:53:40,647 --> 01:53:42,687
I don't even know what
the right thing is, anymore.

2285
01:53:42,711 --> 01:53:44,251
I don't know what I'm supposed to do!

2286
01:53:44,276 --> 01:53:45,438
But I know...

2287
01:53:47,446 --> 01:53:50,077
I can't lose one more friend.

2288
01:53:53,508 --> 01:53:54,436
Gwen...

2289
01:53:54,461 --> 01:53:57,228
I always taught you to do it by the book.

2290
01:53:57,253 --> 01:53:58,589
Yeah, and how did that work out?

2291
01:53:58,614 --> 01:53:59,668
I took an oath.

2292
01:53:59,693 --> 01:54:01,565
Then arrest me, Dad!

2293
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:04,750
- Get it over with.
- I...

2294
01:54:04,775 --> 01:54:05,775
I can't.

2295
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:07,139
Why not?

2296
01:54:07,678 --> 01:54:09,038
Because I quit.

2297
01:54:10,433 --> 01:54:11,433
When?

2298
01:54:12,548 --> 01:54:14,435
About halfway through your big speech.

2299
01:54:15,242 --> 01:54:16,242
You're...

2300
01:54:16,660 --> 01:54:18,900
Wait a minute. You're
not... you're not gonna be captain?

2301
01:54:20,286 --> 01:54:21,332
That means...

2302
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:25,534
My job... being captain...

2303
01:54:26,072 --> 01:54:27,072
This whole...

2304
01:54:27,732 --> 01:54:29,601
thing doesn't matter anymore.

2305
01:54:34,298 --> 01:54:36,284
You're the best thing I've ever done.

2306
01:54:52,015 --> 01:54:53,308
It was a good speech, huh?

2307
01:54:53,333 --> 01:54:54,705
No wonder you got an A in English.

2308
01:54:54,730 --> 01:54:56,674
B. I got a B. Plus.

2309
01:54:56,699 --> 01:54:57,775
Missed a few classes.

2310
01:54:59,853 --> 01:55:01,860
I don't know what it is you gotta do,

2311
01:55:03,795 --> 01:55:06,195
But I... I think that this
thing is supposed to help.

2312
01:55:08,499 --> 01:55:10,592
The guy who left it
was a real piece of work.

2313
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:36,650
I'll be right back.

2314
01:55:38,865 --> 01:55:39,865
Promise.

2315
01:55:47,971 --> 01:55:48,971
Parenting...

2316
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:50,471
stuff is...

2317
01:55:51,926 --> 01:55:53,073
a big-ass mystery.

2318
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:00,540
You're a <i>mistake!</i>

2319
01:56:00,951 --> 01:56:02,537
-If you hadn't been bit,

2320
01:56:02,906 --> 01:56:04,463
Peter Parker would've lived!

2321
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:06,783
And <i>none of this</i> would've happened!

2322
01:56:07,097 --> 01:56:08,132
Miles...

2323
01:56:08,157 --> 01:56:10,511
-the hardest thing about this job is...

2324
01:56:10,879 --> 01:56:12,313
-you can't always save everybody.

2325
01:56:12,338 --> 01:56:13,761
I'll make you pay...

2326
01:56:14,248 --> 01:56:15,943
for everything you took away from me.

2327
01:56:15,968 --> 01:56:18,223
...the choice between saving one person,

2328
01:56:18,248 --> 01:56:21,053
- and an entire world. Every world.
- I can do both!

2329
01:56:21,078 --> 01:56:22,320
Spider man always...

2330
01:56:22,345 --> 01:56:23,470
Not always.

2331
01:56:23,495 --> 01:56:25,421
Whatever you wanna do out there,

2332
01:56:25,446 --> 01:56:26,916
don't get lost.

2333
01:56:26,941 --> 01:56:29,148
- Things are gonna happen.
- I... I didn't know...

2334
01:56:29,173 --> 01:56:31,573
- ...how to tell you.
- You're not supposed to be Spider man!

2335
01:56:34,492 --> 01:56:35,492
Keep going.

2336
01:56:40,373 --> 01:56:41,373
<i>Ah!</i>

2337
01:56:53,187 --> 01:56:54,394
Did you check your locations?

2338
01:56:54,419 --> 01:56:55,281
<i>Yes, Dad.</i>

2339
01:56:55,306 --> 01:56:55,924
No sign of him.

2340
01:56:55,949 --> 01:56:57,688
Lyla, would you just send everyone out?

2341
01:56:57,713 --> 01:56:59,764
Anywhere. Anywhere he might be!

2342
01:56:59,789 --> 01:57:01,229
Congrats, Captain.

2343
01:57:01,254 --> 01:57:03,471
Captain? You can't call
me that 'till I'm sworn in.

2344
01:57:03,496 --> 01:57:04,324
You know that.

2345
01:57:04,349 --> 01:57:05,349
We're all proud of you!

2346
01:57:33,605 --> 01:57:36,209
Perfect pose.

2347
01:57:36,234 --> 01:57:37,376
Wha...?

2348
01:57:37,401 --> 01:57:38,935
Possible disturbance in the alley.

2349
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:40,309
Better go check it out.

2350
01:57:41,009 --> 01:57:42,574
Now, I'm here in the alley.

2351
01:57:43,188 --> 01:57:45,028
There's something unusual happening.

2352
01:57:45,053 --> 01:57:47,176
Looking at the walls... those are normal.

2353
01:57:47,201 --> 01:57:48,603
But there's something in front of me-

2354
01:57:48,627 --> 01:57:49,003
Ah!

2355
01:57:49,028 --> 01:57:51,164
<i>Ohhhh no!</i>

2356
01:58:10,952 --> 01:58:11,952
I made it.

2357
01:58:12,495 --> 01:58:13,495
I'm home.

2358
01:58:18,873 --> 01:58:19,873
Miles?

2359
01:58:25,372 --> 01:58:26,592
Is now a bad time...?

2360
01:58:26,981 --> 01:58:28,968
- Am I... am I too late?
- What'd you do to your hair?

2361
01:58:28,992 --> 01:58:30,737
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay!

2362
01:58:31,865 --> 01:58:32,865
I'm okay...!

2363
01:58:33,561 --> 01:58:34,561
You were right.

2364
01:58:35,404 --> 01:58:36,658
You were right about everything.

2365
01:58:36,682 --> 01:58:38,202
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

2366
01:58:38,687 --> 01:58:39,660
What am I right about?

2367
01:58:39,685 --> 01:58:42,494
I saw... all these amazing places!

2368
01:58:42,519 --> 01:58:44,385
And met all these amazing people!

2369
01:58:44,874 --> 01:58:45,474
But...

2370
01:58:45,499 --> 01:58:46,681
<i>¿Que te pasa, mijo?</i>

2371
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:49,957
But they didn't want me.

2372
01:58:51,101 --> 01:58:53,295
I... I kept thinking about what you said.

2373
01:58:55,067 --> 01:58:56,134
I let 'em have it, Mom.

2374
01:58:57,946 --> 01:58:59,000
I beat 'em all.

2375
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:04,895
I know how strong I am, now.

2376
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:08,112
I'm strong because of you!

2377
01:59:09,270 --> 01:59:10,096
-And Dad!

2378
01:59:10,121 --> 01:59:11,294
<i>¿Que to?</i>

2379
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:12,760
And us!

2380
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:16,490
Mom...

2381
01:59:17,924 --> 01:59:19,391
there's something coming for us.

2382
01:59:21,092 --> 01:59:22,092
Something...

2383
01:59:22,662 --> 01:59:23,753
something terrible.

2384
01:59:23,778 --> 01:59:26,480
Miles, you're talking
crazy. What's going on?

2385
01:59:26,505 --> 01:59:27,505
-His name is Spot.

2386
01:59:28,445 --> 01:59:29,724
He's my nemesis.

2387
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:32,527
And I'm gonna stop him.

2388
01:59:38,255 --> 01:59:40,144
I know you know I've been lying to you.

2389
01:59:41,662 --> 01:59:43,929
It's because I thought if you knew...

2390
01:59:45,188 --> 01:59:46,821
you wouldn't love me the same.

2391
01:59:49,491 --> 01:59:51,184
And then I went out there, and...

2392
01:59:52,671 --> 01:59:53,671
And now...

2393
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:57,179
I'm not afraid of anything.

2394
02:00:00,206 --> 02:00:01,339
What do you wanna tell me?

2395
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:03,741
You gotta promise nothing's gonna change.

2396
02:00:03,766 --> 02:00:05,182
<i>Papa,</i> I will always love you.

2397
02:00:05,207 --> 02:00:05,997
You gotta promise.

2398
02:00:06,022 --> 02:00:07,039
Always.

2399
02:00:07,518 --> 02:00:08,898
I don't care <i>what</i> you say.

2400
02:00:10,028 --> 02:00:11,028
<i>¿Tú me entiendes?</i>

2401
02:00:18,196 --> 02:00:19,196
Mom...

2402
02:00:21,174 --> 02:00:22,174
I'm...

2403
02:00:23,941 --> 02:00:25,161
I'm Spider man.

2404
02:00:36,452 --> 02:00:37,545
Who's Spider man?

2405
02:00:40,127 --> 02:00:41,440
...The superhero?

2406
02:00:42,054 --> 02:00:43,390
He got bit by a spider?

2407
02:00:44,744 --> 02:00:46,564
Gave him spider powers?

2408
02:00:49,265 --> 02:00:50,265
He's me?

2409
02:00:55,181 --> 02:00:58,048
Is this where... like, you dress
up like your favorite character?

2410
02:00:58,073 --> 02:00:59,484
Or, like, what's it called?

2411
02:00:59,509 --> 02:01:00,491
Like Comics Con!

2412
02:01:00,516 --> 02:01:02,132
I don't know what that is.

2413
02:01:02,157 --> 02:01:04,710
You really had me going there, <i>Spider man.</i>

2414
02:01:04,735 --> 02:01:05,990
<i>Imagínate.</i>

2415
02:01:13,913 --> 02:01:15,026
Why don't you have 8 arms?

2416
02:01:15,051 --> 02:01:15,439
Um...

2417
02:01:15,464 --> 02:01:17,273
Do you push silk out of your <i>culito?</i>

2418
02:01:17,298 --> 02:01:18,630
I had a nightmare about that once. But no!

2419
02:01:18,654 --> 02:01:20,129
Are you sure you woke up?

2420
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:40,678
Mom! Stop playing around!

2421
02:01:40,703 --> 02:01:41,897
This is serious!

2422
02:01:41,922 --> 02:01:43,669
Dad worked with Spider man.

2423
02:01:43,694 --> 02:01:46,659
I mean, he didn't realize Spider
man was me at the time, but...

2424
02:01:46,684 --> 02:01:49,742
- I wish Dad was here to explain this.
- Miles, please.

2425
02:01:53,999 --> 02:01:55,192
I got you to take care of,

2426
02:01:55,217 --> 02:01:56,437
I got me to take care of.

2427
02:01:57,022 --> 02:01:58,722
- So help me out.
- Mom, hold on! Hold on!

2428
02:01:58,747 --> 02:01:59,747
I need to talk-

2429
02:02:18,022 --> 02:02:19,022
42.

2430
02:02:25,434 --> 02:02:27,467
Dimensional signature identified.

2431
02:02:46,864 --> 02:02:48,050
Uncle Aaron?

2432
02:02:50,151 --> 02:02:51,151
Hey.

2433
02:03:02,334 --> 02:03:03,334
You okay?

2434
02:03:07,918 --> 02:03:08,918
Whoa!

2435
02:03:09,841 --> 02:03:11,374
I missed you so much.

2436
02:03:11,399 --> 02:03:13,144
Okay.

2437
02:03:13,169 --> 02:03:14,720
Alright, then. Alright.

2438
02:03:14,745 --> 02:03:16,169
Whoa. You took your braids out?

2439
02:03:16,194 --> 02:03:17,132
Uhh...

2440
02:03:17,157 --> 02:03:18,308
- On purpose?
- Yeah.

2441
02:03:18,333 --> 02:03:20,615
Yeah, I'm still...

2442
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,131
...getting used to it?

2443
02:03:23,040 --> 02:03:25,420
They gave me more hours
at the hospital, so next month,

2444
02:03:25,445 --> 02:03:27,050
- I swear, I'll pay you back...
- Stop it, stop it.

2445
02:03:27,074 --> 02:03:28,167
We're family.

2446
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,040
Thanks.

2447
02:03:31,596 --> 02:03:32,690
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

2448
02:03:32,714 --> 02:03:34,410
Hey. How'd it go with Miles?

2449
02:03:34,435 --> 02:03:35,227
Well...

2450
02:03:35,252 --> 02:03:37,175
you know how you grounded him?

2451
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,078
Mm-hmm...

2452
02:03:38,103 --> 02:03:39,232
I ungrounded him.

2453
02:03:39,257 --> 02:03:40,656
You... you what?

2454
02:03:40,681 --> 02:03:42,281
A little bit.

2455
02:03:42,306 --> 02:03:43,620
How much trouble could he get in tonight?

2456
02:03:43,644 --> 02:03:44,666
A lot of trouble!

2457
02:03:44,907 --> 02:03:46,067
I don't wanna think about it.

2458
02:03:47,336 --> 02:03:50,055
Oh, Miles. I have to
work an overnight tonight.

2459
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:51,117
Here's a grocery list.

2460
02:03:51,142 --> 02:03:52,828
I'll make sure he gets this done.

2461
02:03:54,391 --> 02:03:55,611
Alright. We gotta roll.

2462
02:04:00,672 --> 02:04:03,286
Security switches out at
6. That's the window, right?

2463
02:04:03,863 --> 02:04:05,118
...Right. Yep.

2464
02:04:06,216 --> 02:04:08,429
I'm... I'm following you in...

2465
02:04:08,454 --> 02:04:10,348
what you are... saying.

2466
02:04:14,377 --> 02:04:15,377
You alright?

2467
02:04:16,483 --> 02:04:17,937
I have a cold.

2468
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:20,430
C'mon, man.

2469
02:04:21,514 --> 02:04:22,726
Make sure you got the plan.

2470
02:04:23,333 --> 02:04:24,782
Yeah, but... but...

2471
02:04:24,807 --> 02:04:26,912
maybe we should go over it one more time,

2472
02:04:26,937 --> 02:04:29,071
just to make sure there's no...

2473
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:30,803
problems.

2474
02:04:38,235 --> 02:04:40,348
There's no Spider man here.

2475
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:49,840
-Oh, no.

2476
02:04:50,314 --> 02:04:51,314
-Dad...

2477
02:05:11,068 --> 02:05:14,466
I'm sorry, baby, but you
<i>did</i> unilaterally unground him.

2478
02:05:14,491 --> 02:05:15,256
Jeff...

2479
02:05:15,281 --> 02:05:18,886
I just... I just worry about him getting
mixed up with the wrong people, okay?

2480
02:05:18,911 --> 02:05:20,888
This is probably that girl.

2481
02:05:20,913 --> 02:05:23,041
What is he even thinking, being with her?

2482
02:05:23,066 --> 02:05:24,654
I have <i>some</i> ideas.

2483
02:05:24,679 --> 02:05:26,283
Baby... you're really not helping.

2484
02:05:26,308 --> 02:05:28,577
You saw the way he lit up around her!

2485
02:05:30,071 --> 02:05:31,711
-...I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.

2486
02:05:34,952 --> 02:05:36,998
I mean, am I responsible for this?

2487
02:05:37,023 --> 02:05:38,092
No, no!

2488
02:05:38,117 --> 02:05:38,940
Maybe it's all my fault!

2489
02:05:38,965 --> 02:05:41,441
Come on, <i>papa,</i> you're a great dad.

2490
02:05:41,466 --> 02:05:41,952
This is all...

2491
02:05:41,977 --> 02:05:44,593
It's just... it's hard. It's like...

2492
02:05:44,618 --> 02:05:48,313
we got a whole new kid who
just wants to grow up so fast.

2493
02:05:50,273 --> 02:05:52,320
And maybe, we gotta grow up, too.

2494
02:05:53,992 --> 02:05:54,992
A little bit.

2495
02:05:55,477 --> 02:05:58,071
Maybe we just gotta let
him spread his wings, man.

2496
02:05:58,724 --> 02:05:59,724
"Man"?

2497
02:06:00,233 --> 02:06:01,507
It's not your fault.

2498
02:06:04,224 --> 02:06:05,257
It's mine.

2499
02:06:05,855 --> 02:06:08,324
Oh, come on. What the
heck are you doing here?

2500
02:06:08,349 --> 02:06:10,902
Oh, uhh, his window was open, so I came in.

2501
02:06:10,927 --> 02:06:13,531
Because that's... normal... to do.

2502
02:06:13,556 --> 02:06:14,877
I wanna talk to your parents.

2503
02:06:14,902 --> 02:06:17,256
Right. My, uhh... my dad's
kinda hard to get on the horn.

2504
02:06:17,281 --> 02:06:18,618
Oh, really? What does he do?

2505
02:06:18,643 --> 02:06:19,643
Deal drugs?

2506
02:06:20,185 --> 02:06:21,185
He's a cop.

2507
02:06:23,453 --> 02:06:24,773
Statement withdrawn.

2508
02:06:25,486 --> 02:06:26,607
Yep, well, I'm gonna call the station.

2509
02:06:26,631 --> 02:06:28,766
I don't think he's there. Or...

2510
02:06:28,791 --> 02:06:29,959
anywhere around here.

2511
02:06:29,984 --> 02:06:31,597
Well, that's his jacket, emo!

2512
02:06:31,622 --> 02:06:32,330
Where's Miles?

2513
02:06:32,355 --> 02:06:32,854
I don't know.

2514
02:06:32,879 --> 02:06:34,185
<i>You don't know?</i>

2515
02:06:34,210 --> 02:06:35,336
What do you mean, you don't know?!

2516
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:36,942
Yeah. Umm... I'll leave.

2517
02:06:36,967 --> 02:06:38,777
Where do you think
<i>you're</i> going, young lady?

2518
02:06:39,377 --> 02:06:40,684
I'm going to find him.

2519
02:06:42,103 --> 02:06:43,857
I don't know where, exactly...

2520
02:06:45,513 --> 02:06:46,867
But I know where to start.

2521
02:06:48,819 --> 02:06:50,486
One thing I learned from Miles...

2522
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:53,720
it's all possible.

2523
02:06:56,440 --> 02:06:59,593
He loves you more than
you could ever imagine.

2524
02:07:03,756 --> 02:07:04,756
I've seen it.

2525
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:11,547
If you do find him...

2526
02:07:13,853 --> 02:07:15,639
tell him 5 months.

2527
02:07:18,046 --> 02:07:19,779
And tell him we love him.

2528
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:22,620
You got it.

2529
02:07:56,542 --> 02:07:57,542
Uncle Aaron...

2530
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:05,510
Wait, wait.

2531
02:08:05,744 --> 02:08:06,944
I was... listen.

2532
02:08:07,302 --> 02:08:08,302
Okay, um...

2533
02:08:12,494 --> 02:08:13,654
You don't understand.

2534
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:14,779
I'm not from here.

2535
02:08:15,924 --> 02:08:17,819
I'm from an entirely different dimension.

2536
02:08:18,443 --> 02:08:20,169
Wait, wait, wait. Please, please. Please!

2537
02:08:20,194 --> 02:08:21,194
Please!

2538
02:08:21,474 --> 02:08:22,860
I got sent here by mistake!

2539
02:08:22,885 --> 02:08:25,510
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Uncle Aaron!

2540
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:41,330
Please.

2541
02:08:41,524 --> 02:08:42,570
Uncle Aaron?

2542
02:08:43,689 --> 02:08:45,255
Just... hear me out.

2543
02:08:48,950 --> 02:08:51,476
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

2544
02:08:52,379 --> 02:08:54,032
It wasn't supposed to bite <i>me,</i>

2545
02:08:54,057 --> 02:08:56,022
it was supposed to bite someone else.

2546
02:08:56,047 --> 02:08:57,047
Someone from here.

2547
02:08:57,999 --> 02:08:58,999
I don't belong here.

2548
02:08:59,391 --> 02:09:00,391
I need to go home.

2549
02:09:00,836 --> 02:09:01,836
Okay?

2550
02:09:03,954 --> 02:09:06,388
I have an Uncle Aaron, too. I-I <i>had</i> one.

2551
02:09:06,956 --> 02:09:09,962
He was a bad guy... called the Prowler.

2552
02:09:09,987 --> 02:09:12,658
He... he looked out for me.

2553
02:09:12,683 --> 02:09:14,927
He did a lot of bad things, but...

2554
02:09:15,781 --> 02:09:17,373
I knew he wanted to be good.

2555
02:09:17,927 --> 02:09:19,582
He just... didn't know he had a choice,

2556
02:09:19,606 --> 02:09:20,647
but you do!

2557
02:09:21,659 --> 02:09:23,126
You can be a good guy!

2558
02:09:24,944 --> 02:09:25,979
A good guy?

2559
02:09:26,535 --> 02:09:28,522
Please, just trust me.

2560
02:09:28,547 --> 02:09:30,067
I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.

2561
02:09:42,866 --> 02:09:43,866
I'm not.

2562
02:10:22,358 --> 02:10:23,685
Your dad is still alive?

2563
02:10:24,639 --> 02:10:25,639
What?

2564
02:10:26,443 --> 02:10:27,443
Your father.

2565
02:10:28,354 --> 02:10:29,667
You said he's still alive.

2566
02:10:31,152 --> 02:10:32,152
Yeah.

2567
02:10:34,836 --> 02:10:35,836
Huh.

2568
02:10:37,264 --> 02:10:38,264
Who are you?

2569
02:10:47,569 --> 02:10:48,928
I'm Miles Morales.

2570
02:10:51,455 --> 02:10:52,502
But you...

2571
02:10:53,154 --> 02:10:54,794
you can call me the Prowler.

2572
02:10:57,087 --> 02:10:58,374
If I don't get home...

2573
02:11:00,027 --> 02:11:01,824
our dad... is going to die.

2574
02:11:01,849 --> 02:11:03,127
<i>Your</i> dad.

2575
02:11:05,726 --> 02:11:06,726
Please.

2576
02:11:08,538 --> 02:11:09,911
You have to let me go.

2577
02:11:16,111 --> 02:11:17,204
Why would I do that?

2578
02:12:17,118 --> 02:12:18,191
Don't tell Mom.

2579
02:12:25,282 --> 02:12:27,182
I never found the right band to join.

2580
02:12:29,389 --> 02:12:31,176
So, I started my own.

2581
02:12:35,173 --> 02:12:36,346
With a few old friends.

2582
02:12:58,841 --> 02:12:59,841
Want in?
