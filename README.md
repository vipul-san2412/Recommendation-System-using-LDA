# Topic Modeling-Based Content Recommendation System Using LDA Algorithm

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Topic Modeling-Based Content Recommendation System Using LDA Algorithm," developed as part of a B.Tech. project from December 2018 to May 2019.

## Project Overview

The project aims to build a content recommendation system using topic modeling analysis on the Netflix dataset. By employing the LDA algorithm, we analyzed relationships between genres and assessed the semantic similarity of words within topics using coherence measures. These insights were utilized to develop an effective recommendation system.
